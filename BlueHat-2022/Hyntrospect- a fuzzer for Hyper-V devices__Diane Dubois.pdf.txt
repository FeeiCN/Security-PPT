Why Hyper-V?
 Project Zero mission  Running on
 ... and because virtualization is a fun topic  Multiple layers from hardware to high level software  Complex implementations

Goals
 Instrumenting Hyper-V for vulnerability research  Fuzzer called Hyntrospect: https://github.com/googleprojectzero/Hyntrospect
 Finding vulnerabilities and reporting them to Microsoft

Agenda

What is a Guest to Host Escape?
 Gaining code execution on one of the hypervisor layers from a virtual machine
 On Hyper-V: several layers
 Also Host denial of service, leaks ...

The Hypervisors' Attack Surface
As defined by Alisa Esage (Zer0Con 2020)

...and in practice

Hyper-V Attack Surface

Hypervisor  Hypercall handlers  Faults  Instruction emulation  Intercepts  Register access (MSRs...)

Root partition  Kernel
 VMBus  Drivers (storage...)  Userland  Emulated devices  Integration components

... and this list is not exhaustive MSRC: first-steps-in-hyper-v-research

Research - State of the Art
 MSRC and Microsoft publish on Hyper-V  Security blog posts: e.g. First Steps in Hyper-V research  Posts on Hyper-V components  Talks on vulnerabilities found internally e.g. Breaking VSM by Attacking SecureKernel at BlackHatUSA 2020  Symbols for some key components
 Active external contributors: @gerhart_x, @alisaesage, @erynian... And many more (GitHub/gerhart01/Hyper-V-Internals)

The Research Target

Guest
Unmodified image

Another guest

Drivers
Hypervisor Hardware

The Emulated Devices Controllers
 Access by the VM to the hardware
 Emulation of hardware controller by the hypervisor  Hypervisor as a proxy  Guest operating systems unmodified
 Called "virtual devices" or "VDEVs" at Microsoft

...on Hyper-V
 Generation 1 VMs  Azure mostly uses this generation
 Userland of the root partition  DLLs loaded by the worker process

Why Choose the
Emulated Devices
 Complex (state machines)  For example: enable / disable ports, update a status register, wait for a command
 Several bugs on several hypervisors  Azure mostly uses Generation 1 VMs  Hyper-V is developed in C++  Potential "guest to root partition" escapes

Life of a Request
 Communication through IO ports  CPU instructions: IN / OUT  "IN EAX, DX"  "OUT DX, EAX"
 Communication through the hypervisor, the VID, and callbacks
 Some VDEVs are more complex  MMIO handling  Use of the VMBus
 More on MSRC blogpost "Attacking the VM worker process"

Some Reverse Engineering

 DLL implementing the controllers  Typical IO handlers
 $Device::NotifyIOPortRead  $Device::NotifyIOPortWrite

Example: VmEmulatedStorage.dll

+
Symbols No particular difficulty (obfuscation...)

C++, indirect calls

 CVE-2018-0959 + Dedicated MSRC blogpost
How to do the same, closed source?

Existing Tools for Windows Binaries Fuzzing

 DynamoRIO  Intel Pin  Intel PT  Mesos  QDBI for Windows  TinyInst

 WinAFL + DynamoRIO
 Jackalope  whvp

PageHeap

So Why Another Tool?
 The target is a DLL  Emulating only the relevant functions is hard  vmwp binary and the DLL cannot be restarted with instrumentation  The runtime operations are specific: IOs injections  Some tools were developed during Hyntrospect development  Managing all the blocks with a minimal set of languages is hard  The fuzzer will be ported to similar use cases

Scope
 Windows guest VM  Intel CPU  Generation 1VMs  Binaries (DLLs/EXEs) in the userland of the root partition

int3 technique
 Pre-compute the list of targeted blocks' addresses  Set int3 at the beginning of each block  Each int3 reached = coverage increase  The int3 is removed, input file handled, execution resumes  Faster over time

Generation of the Input File
 Record of seeds at the beginning [optional]  Corpus of "interesting files"  Coverage increase -> truncated input file added to the corpus  3 strategies: mutate, append, generate randomly
 Format of input files  Byte 0 % 2 -> IN / OUT operation  Byte 1 % (number of ports) -> selected IO port  Byte 2 % 3 -> length  If OUT and based on length -> value

Crash Qualification
 2 levels of monitoring:  Debugger level  Monitoring process
 Tip: track the VM uptime
 Crash folder created with logs and artefacts to re-run the case

Coverage Visualization in IDA
Optionally, using a helper and IDA + LightHouse

Current results

Local runs
 First targets: i8042 (PS/2), videoS3, floppy, IDE  Example: I8042 device with IO ports 0x60, 0x61, 0x62, 0x64
 Local setup:  Dedicated workstation  32 GB RAM and Intel Core i9 CPU  8 GB per VM, 1 or 2 vCPUs  Windows 10
 Speed limitation  Main factor: number of breakpoints  Time to set them / update them in DbgShell  Not linear
 Next goal: port the fuzzer to GCP/Azure

Number of breakpoints

Current coverage 42.7% 40%
Current coverage 43.3% 28.8%

 Start / init / stop functions not called  Attaching to a running VM
 Debug strings blocks skipped

Guest VM Crash found
 On i8042 device  Reproducible  BSOD of the VM with different error messages at each run
 SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION (0x3b)  PFN_LIST_CORRUPT (4e)  ATTEMPTED_WRITE_TO_READONLY_MEMORY (0xbe)  KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILURE (0x139) ...  Memory corruption error

Some more investigation
 Narrowed down the case  Sequence of 2 OUT operations  State machine, path accessible in 2 steps
 PciBusDevice::HandleA20GateChange  Legacy A20 device  Updates the host memory mapping  ... but the guest keeps the same mapping
 Question: possible compromise of VBS?

Follow-up
 In practice, impossible to exploit  Not a security bug  Shared with MSRC
 Validates the behavior of the fuzzer, crash handling and reproduction scripts
 Highlights that this surface has probably been well covered

Future Endeavours

Design Limitations
 Space: Restricted to the userland of the root partition  Time: Not optimized for speed

Future Work
 Development of the fuzzer internals  Mutation strategy  Redevelop some parts in C++ or C# for performance  Speed-related updates: towards a minimal debugger?  [not prioritized] Userland vs kernel (or hAFL1?)
 Porting to GCP / Azure  Port to new devices  Run faster and longer
 Adapting to other root partition targets  Keeping the frame and "basic blocks"  Changing the commands and input consumption  Other interesting dlls loaded in vmwp.exe (generation 2).
