Once upon a time...
there was a single decentralized blockchain

6 years later...
A new general-purpose blockchain called Ethereum came to life

Fast forward to today -
A multi-chain present and future

What about cross-chain?
Blockchains are great but cannot trustlessly interact with each other

Interoperability User Experience and Capital Efficiency

Bridges to the rescue!

Bridges are cool
So how can we break them? Starting with the Polygon PoS bridge

The Polygon chain
 Powered by Proof of Stake  Polygon chain has so-called validator nodes powering it  Validators stake tokens, mine new blocks in the chain and get rewarded for it

Polygon PoS bridge
 Bridges tokens to and from Ethereum to Polygon  The bridge is composed by a set of contracts that are deployed on Ethereum
and Polygon
 Moving assets from Ethereum to Polygon  Lock assets into Ethereum PoS bridge contracts  Validator nodes monitor Ethereum contracts logs  Wrapped assets are minted on Polygon

Polygon PoS bridge - cont.
 Withdrawing wrapped assets from Polygon back to Ethereum  Burn the asset on Polygon  Save the tx hash  Wait for a checkpoint to be sent to Ethereum  Submit a proof of the burn on Ethereum to release the asset
 How can the contracts on Ethereum trust the proof of something that happened on Polygon? What's even a checkpoint?

Checkpointing
Checkpointing is the process of merging the Polygon transactions into the Ethereum blockchain

Why consensus matters
 Checkpoints are accepted only if  + 1 of the total staking power of the validators signed the checkpoint
 Checkpoints are then used to verify proofs of burnt tokens in Polygon  A malicious checkpoint can drain the pool of the bridge

Validator #1

Stake 100 MATIC

Stake 70 MATIC
Stake 50 MATIC
Validator #3

Validator #2

Total staking power: 220
 * 220 + 1 = 148 for a checkpoint to be accepted

How does staking work?

 There are currently 100 validator nodes on Polygon  Running a validator node is a hassle  Fortunately anyone can delegate any amount of tokens into any validator node  Example:
Total staking power: 100

Validator #1

Stake 100 MATIC

Total staking power: 170

To accept a new checkpoint submission - signed staking power on that submission has
to be at least: *220 + 1 = 148

Total staking power: 230

Migrating delegator tokens
 A delegator can also migrate from one validator to another if he desires without needing to pull his tokens out
 Example:
Total staking power: 230

Validator #1

Stake 100 MATIC

Stake 70 MATIC

Validator #2

Stake 50 MATIC

Validator #3

Stake 10 MATIC

Delegator

How does unstaking work?
 Validators can unstake when they want to  Total staking power counter has to decrease accordingly  Example:

Total staking power: 230

Validator #1

Stake 100 MATIC

Stake 70 MATIC Stake 50 MATIC

Validator #2

Stake 10 MATIC

Delegator

Validator #3

How does unstaking work?

 Validators can unstake when they want to
 Total staking power counter has to decrease accordingly  Example:

Total staking power: 180

Validator #1

Stake 100 MATIC

Stake 70 MATIC Unstake

Validator #2

Stake 10 MATIC

Delegator

Validator #3

One counter to rule them all
 The total staking power counter is a very important number  Recap: A checkpoint can be accepted only if >=  * total staking power + 1
staking power has signed it
What if we could bypass that consensus check somehow?

Breaking the bridge
 Validators can unstake when they want to  Delegators can migrate when they want to  Example:

Validator #1

Stake 100 MATIC

Stake 70 MATIC Stake 50 MATIC

Validator #2

Validator #3

Stake 10 MATIC

Delegator

Total staking power: 230

Breaking the bridge
 Validators can unstake when they want to  Delegators can migrate when they want to  Example:

Validator #1

Stake 100 MATIC

Stake 70 MATIC Unstake

Validator #2

Validator #3

Stake 10 MATIC

Delegator

Total staking power: 170

Breaking the bridge
 Validators can unstake when they want to  Delegators can migrate when they want to  Example:

Total staking power: 170

Validator #1

Stake 100 MATIC

Unstake
Validator #3

Stake 70 MATIC

Validator #2

Stake 10 MATIC

Delegator

Migration did not regard the fact that validator #3 unstaked! The total staking power remained 170 instead of 180

Breaking the bridge
 Validators can unstake when they want to  Delegators can migrate when they want to  Example:

Total staking power: 90

Validator #1

Stake 100 MATIC

Unstake
Validator #3

Unstake

Validator #2

Stake 10 MATIC

Delegator

The same delegated tokens were decreased from the total staking power twice

Breaking the bridge
 Validators can unstake when they want to  Delegators can migrate when they want to  Example:

Validator #1

Stake 100 MATIC

Stake 10 MATIC

Delegator

Unstake
Unstake
Validator #3

Validator #2

Total staking power: 90

Breaking the bridge
 Validators can unstake when they want to  Delegators can migrate when they want to  Example:

Total staking power: -20

Validator #1

Unstake

Unstake

Validator #2

Stake 10 MATIC
Delegator

Unstake
Validator #3

And now for the third time. Once staking power is low enough for you - send a malicious checkpoint that fakes that you burnt billions of $
worth of tokens in Polygon.

Draining the bridge
1. Delegate X tokens into some validator 2. Catch a validator slot 3. Migrate your X tokens into that validator 4. Unstake the validator 5. Repeat step 2 to step 4 until X >=  * total staking power + 1 6. Submit a checkpoint signed by only you that drains all deposited tokens in the
bridge 7. Profit billions of dollars

Summary
1. Bridges are complex constructs, possibly with a locked value of billions of people's funds
2. Security audits are nice and all but are insufficient 3. The industry needs more (whitehat) eyes on critical infrastructure
