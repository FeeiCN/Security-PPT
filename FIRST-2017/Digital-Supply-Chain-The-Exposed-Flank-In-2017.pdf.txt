DEFENDING THE EXPOSED FLANK
DIGITAL SUPPLY CHAIN SECURITY
FIRST 2017

Hi

I'm Martin McKeay

I have been in security for almost two decades

I have the scars to prove it

I am the Sr. Editor of the State of the Internet/Security report

Now, I work for

This isn't a vendor pitch

I'm here to talk about the exposed flank

Digital Supply Chain Security

ACT 1
MEANING

PHYSICAL SUPPLY CHAIN

DIGITAL SUPPLY CHAIN

WHAT DO I MEAN?
 Supply chain in this perspective is the managing of the internal components of an organization.
 The security to ensure the integrity of the information technology systems.
 Addressing security at all points in the workflow so that attackers may not openly compromise systems.
 Attackers might have been focused on stealing trucks historically, now they're after your code.

WHO ELSE IS TALKING ABOUT THIS?

EXAMPLE OF A DIGITAL PICTURE FRAME OR USB DRIVE
HOW DID MY WIDGET GET HERE?

MALWARE IN THE PIPELINE...
 Supply chain issues with regard to Information Technology began to show themselves early on.

OR WORSE...
POOR SECURITY IN CODE

THE GROUND FLOOR
 The focus in supply chain security has historically been towards enhancing the physical security of the supply chain logistics.
 Lack of concentration on the information technology/security  Greater move to decentralized information technology solutions
with global scale  Information technology and the supply chain

WHO CARES?
 Who is taking the time to work on the problem?
 Organization that on supply chain include:
 World Customs Organization (WCO), Customs Trade Partnership against Terrorism (C-TPAT), Container Security Initiative(CSI) from the US Customs and Border Protection and the Global Security Initiative from DHS.
 ISO/PAS 28000 "Specification for security management systems for the supply chain"

MAGINOT LINE
 There is a concerted effort to secure physical side of logistics.  IT solutions as they relate to supply chain have typically lacked
the same focus.  So why should this be of concern?  Well...

CASE IN POINT...

WHAT COULD GO WRONG?

WAR STORIES AND SUCH
ACT II

GLOBAL, LEGAL, COMPLEXITY, HUMAN...
CHALLENGES & COMPLICATIONS

CHALLENGES
 As we have more an more products delivered to us faster and cheaper the scale of operations has gone to go global scale.
 What are some impacts of this move?  Outsourced help desk  Offshore development centres  Partner networks

GEOPOLITICAL

LEGAL ISSUES
 Legal issues are now global ones as supply chain expands across the globe.
 How do laws affect the production supply chain?  Is there a lack of enforcement of said laws?  Are you even legally able to be operating in the country?  Ignorance of the law is no defense.

ATM, FAVORITE OF NE'ER DO WELLS

ANOTHER LEGAL ISSUE EXAMPLE, ATM FRAUD

THE FLOW

WHAT WENT WRONG?
 Vulnerable financial institutions  Credit card processor was breached on two occasions  Withdrawal limits removed on prepaid debit cards  Cashing teams: 36,000 transactions and withdrew about $40
million from machines in the various countries in about 10 hours

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 We have all read about the APT problems.  Concerted efforts to purloin Intellectual Property. (Source Code,
Process, Secret Sauce)  Using tools like Perforce and Git (as examples) partners often
want access to source code.  Too often they get this access as a "business decision" which is
your organization's secret sauce.

SOURCE CODE ISSUES

...AND SO ON

PARTNER NETWORKS
 Many manufacturing companies build and maintain interconnected networks
 The "I have a firewall so I'm OK" mentality should be shelved.  Do you check your third party connections?  Trust But (Test and) Verify

HARDWARE TROJANS

MORE RECENTLY...

BATTLEFIELD ROBOTS

YIPES!

OH...RIGHT

WAIT WHAT?
THIS IS REAL

THE TECHNOLOGY
ISN'T THERE YET

WHERE TO FROM HERE?
ACT III

GO BEYOND COMPLIANCE
 Compliance regimes are to address the BARE MINIMUM

OFF SHORE DEVELOPMENT
 Greater diligence is required when signing a contract  The lowest bid is not always the best choice  Ensure that you're development partner adheres to your security
requirements  Make sure that they do not have offices in restricted countries  Software liability?

HAMSTER WHEEL OF PAIN
 How do we get off this wheel of security issues?
 We need to be able to reproduce good results

DEFINED REPEATABLE PROCESSES
 There needs to be a concentration on defined repeatable processes
 Too often companies treat third party connections as one offs. (not for all of course)
 Not having a defined onboarding process for partners can result in unintended consequences.

THE BUDGET BATTLE
 The hardest battle I have ever fought has been for budget
 You need to make a strong case that articulates the risks to the business in terms that the business can understand.
 Avoid the fear, uncertainty and doubt if at all possible.

INTERNAL APPLICATIONS
 Conduct code reviews. Go beyond unit tests.
 Hire third party companies to review code.
 Keep documentation current

INFRASTRUCTURE , DNS & WEB APPLICATIONS
 You have limited resources
 Concentrate on the items that are important in your supply chain
 Have a trusted partner

BUILD TO FAIL
 As with any IT implementation failure will come
 Make your applications/infrastructure resilient
 Don't build for five nines
 Build to fail

BAMBOO ANALOGY
 Supply chain has many points that can be exploited along the way
 It is important to have a supply chain that can adapt

Thank you for taking the time to listen to me!
