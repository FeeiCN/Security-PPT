AIL Framework for Analysis of Information Leaks
From a CSIRT use-case towards a generic analysis open source software

FIRST 2017

Leaks and CSIRT day-to-day operations
 Analysing and notifying about information leaks can be time consuming (e.g. national/sectoral CSIRT level)
 Notification can be challenging (e.g. what kind of trusted channels do you have to communicate with a victim?)
 When leaks are publicly known, interaction with media/press can be significant
 Analysis of mixed structured and unstructured data from untrusted sources (e.g. fake and duplicate leaks)

A source of leaks: Paste monitoring
 Example: http://pastebin.com/  Easily storing and sharing text online  Used by programmers and legitimate users  Source code & configuration information
 Abused by attackers to store:  List of vulnerable/compromised sites  Software vulnerability (e.g. exploits)  Database dumps  User data  Credentials (3rd party)  Credit card details  ... more and more ...

Paste monitoring: TR-46 approach
 How to deal with numerous requests from press/media or potential victims. The TR-46 document includes:  Risks with stolen email addresses  Risks with stolen (hashed) passwords  How to mitigate the risks  How to prevent collateral damage  How do we find leaks  Reference of leaks (with the number of affected users in CIRCL's constituency)
 We don't provide any form for validation of email/credential leaks. This can be conflictual with general security awareness (e.g. entering email/credentials on unknown websites).

AIL Framework
 AIL initially started as an internship project (2014) to evaluate the feasibility to automate the analysis of (un)structured information to find leaks.
 In 2017, AIL framework is an open source software in Python. The software is actively used (and maintained)1 by CIRCL.
 Extending AIL to add a new analysis module can be done in 50 lines of Python.
 The framework supports multi-processors/cores by default. Any analysis module can be started multiple times to support faster processing during peak times or bulk import.

AIL - A sample module structure
import time import re from pubsublogger import publisher from packages import Paste from Helper import Process if __name__ == '__main__':
# Port of the redis instance used by pubsublogger publisher.port = 6380 # Script is the default channel used for the modules. publisher.channel = 'Script' # Section name in bin/packages/modules.cfg config_section = 'Cve' # Setup the I/O queues p = Process(config_section) # Sent to the logging a description of the module publisher.info("Run CVE module") # Endless loop getting messages from the input queue while True:
message = p.get_from_set() if message is None:
publisher.debug("{} queue is empty , waiting".format(config_section)) time . sleep (1) continue cveextract(message)

Conclusion
 Building AIL helped us to find additional leaks which cannot be found using manual analysis and improve the time to detect duplicate/recycled leaks.
  Therefore quicker response time to assist and/or inform proactively affected constituents.
 Separating collection and analysis parts allowed us to extend the models in the CSIRT services.
 The modular architecture helped us to use the extracted data to feed Passive DNS or crawl Tor .onion.
 Ongoing work: Integrating AIL leak into MISP to curate, share and collaborate on leaks.
