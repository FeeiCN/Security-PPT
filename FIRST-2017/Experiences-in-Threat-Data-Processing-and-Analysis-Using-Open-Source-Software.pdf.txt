Forward-looking Threat Research?

Ye olden times
Random scripts in random places running ... well ... randomly well Used PostgresQL, MySQL (MariaDB), CouchDB or who knows? Monitoring? What monitoring? Snowflakes everywhere

Life sucked

Let's (Re)design!

What we really want
7

This sounded good

Volume

Velocity

Variety

Veracity

Data at rest

Data in motion Many forms of data

Data in doubt

?

WTF

Goals
 Support investigations, e-crime hunting and data analysis  Provide one-stop shopping for infrastructure and threat data
 A large diversity of data  One data source - multiple UIs
 Draw from a pool of existing OSS UIs  Oh, and we a lot of data
9

NFRs*
 Shouldn't cost anything  objectives change frequently  investment would be wasted
 Should be FOSS  Community can rise around it better  Code inspection can lead to insights
*Non-Functional Requirements
10

What we liked
 Riak  Scaled horizontally
 CouchDB  JSON data model
 Elasticsearch!
11

The Experimental ELK
 We built a small Elasticsearch 1.6 Cluster  Elasticsearch at it's core  Logstash for ingest  Kibana as main UI
12

Laser: The Modified ELK
 Turns out Logstash sucked for our purposes  Slow  Bad failure mode on dirty data
 Replaced it with StreamSets  Helps us handle data drift and transformations
13

Homogenisation

 ip vs ipaddr vs Inet vs ipv4 vs ip4 vs ...

 2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:0000:1428:57ab vs 2001:0db8:0:0::1428:57ab vs 2001:0db8::1428:57ab vs [2001:0db8::1428:57ab]

 example.com vs example.com.

Milk

vs .com.example

 Both keys and values need to be homogenised

 Use ontologies to help model data

14

Enrichment

 GeoIP  subdomain stripping  URL componentization  Polymorphisms

RDNS Domain ASN IP
WhoIs

15

But wait! Why not SolrCloud?
 Difficult decision as we already use SolrCloud in an R&D project  Both are based on Lucene  Both scale  Our deciding factor
 Community!  Momentum!
16

Also needed more robust infrastructure
 All major deployments via Ansible  Ansible Vault!
 Apache Mesos  Docker containerisation  Enterprise Github
 git-crypt!  Small ES cluster for logging

SSDEEP alternative, TLSH: https://github.com/trendmicro/tlsh
22

Running
 ~ 50TB of data (at ~75% capacity)  Running at 100% capacity not advisable unless data is static
 Running 9 data-only machines  With 128G memory, 64 vCPUs  Each has 2 ES nodes
 6 client nodes on VMs with 64G memory and 2 CPU  Partitioned for ingest and querying
 4 master nodes on VMs
23

Security
 Um, there is none  OK, there is X-Pack for $$$
 Tried it  Caused a lot of headaches  Couldn't afford it  Trashed it  Now what?  Zero-Trust networking
24

Data
 Homogenization  Can ask `give me all of x' questions  Important for aggregations!
 But we skip it for one-off projects  Multiple ingests as we learn more about the data  versioned indices e.g., dataset-v1-20170601, dataset-v2-20170601
 Ingest can take days for some datasets
25

Querying
 Most users use Kibana  Also offer a proprietary UI
 For simple queries  Jupyter for more difficult tasks  Zeppelin as alternative
26

Conclusions
27

Relax, it will be all over soon
 It's not a silver bullet  Shards, fields, server config
 constantly needs rebalancing  Re-indexing needed
 New query requirements  New ES features
28

Would we do it all again?
 Probably yes  Elasticsearch keeps getting better
 One wish: At least security should be free  Not perfect for anything, but
 Flexible enough to cope with nearly everything we throw at it
29

Outlook
 We are experimenting with large graph DBs  Stardog  BlazeGraph  Neo4J
30

Threat Intel FTW!
