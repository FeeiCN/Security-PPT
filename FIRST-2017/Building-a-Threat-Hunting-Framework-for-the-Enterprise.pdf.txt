Hunting Update

 2 Years Target

The Task
 Significantly improve hunting!
 I don't know what that is!
 Nobody else does either!

What it's not.
 Detection
 Artifact based  Known values/behaviors  Signature based

 Traditional IR
 Artifact based  Take alert for x, evaluate
 -good or bad
 Work thru time

Nothing wrong with either one
 They serve their purpose
 But they don't find unknown

Needed to fill gaps.
 Look for Unknowns  Iterative  Precipitated by need  Data Analytics

Mapped to Attacker Lifecycle
RDP External Access

Hunting is Different...
 Still Artifacts
 In Context
 Time
 network
 Space
 Host
 Attackers have patterns

Mission Statement
Hunt team activities will use intelligence driven use cases to iteratively search the enterprise forest for advanced indicators of compromise missed by conventional detection methods. Our goal is to terminate ongoing malicious activity and produce actionable intelligence to improve Target's security posture. Use cases will be generated using internal and open source intelligence, situational awareness of emerging and current threats, and available data about the current state of the enterprise network. Findings will be utilized to create cases for isolation and investigation, close detection gaps, and create actionable alerting.

So now we need how?
 Easy to say what hunting is.
 How do I make it into a process for others to easily follow?
 I thought what we are doing is similar to any evidence based questions.

 We just need to communicate

We break communication down as
 Cases:  Detection Gaps:  Informational:

Current State
 What Hunting did to improve right now
 Found x infections  This That etc.
 Look how cool I am

Future State
 Our IR is bigger, stronger, faster  We now know x  We can now find x

Building the Team
 Knowledge is power
 Not all about us
 Security can influence more than security...maybe

Seats at the table
 Not a function of only IR  Growth requires the
participation of all key-players  Read-ON  Read-Off  Planning

Practical Application
 Playbooks :
 Threathunting.net  Track historical
knowledge  Reference beginning
 Read-On Read-Off
 Communicate to future and leadership

Outside Participation
 Not just IR aanlyst

Einstein vs High School Teacher

Scientific Process
 Relies on two legs
 The data used  The process/knowledge of analyst

Stage 2: HMI 1 HMI 2 HMI 3

Stage 3: HMI 2 HMI 3 HMI 4

Not a Linear measurement
 Data
 What are we looking at?
 Analysis
 Who and how are we looking?

Three Stages Each Way
 Reflects growth of People
 Analysis
 From uninformed to highly knowledgeable
 Reflects growth of Technology
 Data
 From standard to use specific

Data Stage 1:
 Standard byproduct data sets
 Not specific  Functional data  Think Firewall logs

Data Stage 2:
 Data Collection
 SIEM  Data for data's sake  Correlation

Data Stage 3:
 For hunting
 Data that is only valuable for pattern based big picture searches  Not useful for alerting  Probably difficult and expensive

Analysis Stage 1:
 Others automation  Entry level  Often tied to vendor solutions

Analysis Stage 2:
 Research based
 What do we know?  How do we identify?  What is it in my environment?
 Allow investment in analyst!!!!

Analysis Stage 3:
 Heavy investment in analyst!!!  Self made automation.  Allows rapid iteration.

Maturity Phases PCR Example

Data Stages: Proxy Logs
Examine Logs, Compare Singular Events - Bytes in vs Bytes out but only on single connection

Analysis Stages: Just evaluating individual connections.

Examine Groups of Logs - Group by user - Bytes in vs Bytes out over period of time - Virus Total and Alexa to Reduce Data Set
Weigh Data against Itself - 30 day average of PCR - 24 hr as change against 30 day average

Requires Analyst to engage in data and develop plan for processing larger datasets.
Requires the analyst to develop a plan to look at large data sets and plan an evaluation technique. Reduces the hunt to what is critical. Use of visualization for rapid iteration.
