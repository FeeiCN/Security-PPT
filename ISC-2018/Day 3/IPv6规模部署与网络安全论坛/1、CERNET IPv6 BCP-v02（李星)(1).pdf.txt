 The IETF is willing to respond to the pervasive surveillance attack?
 Overwhelming YES. Silence for NO.
 Pervasive surveillance is an attack, and the IETF needs to adjust our threat model to consider it when developing standards track specifications.
 Very strong YES. Silence for NO
 The IETF should include encryption, even outside authentication, where practical.
 Strong YES. Silence for NO
 The IETF should strive for end-to-end encryption, even when there are middleboxes in the path.
 Mixed response, but more YES than NO.
 Many insecure protocols are used in the Internet today, and the IETF should create a secure alternative for the popular ones.
 Mostly YES, but some NO.

Hardening The Internet





Project to 2051

Success
 In IC industry, if you don't know how to waste transistors, you will fail.
 In network industry, if you don't know how to waste bandwidth, you will fail.
 In next generation Internet industry, if you don't know how to waste addresses, you will fail.
