DATASHEET

Reduce the Burden of Vendor Risk Assessments with a Data Sharing Community of 23,000+ Vendors
How You (and Your Vendors) Benefit from Shared Data in the Cyber Risk Exchange
There is immense value in working together, leveraging collective intelligence and shared resources instead of operating in siloes. What if we could apply this "community" concept to vendor risk assessments? By facilitating the "exchange" of pre-completed and validated assessments, the OneTrust Vendorpedia Cyber Risk Exchange benefits both the assessor and the respondent. Respondents can complete an assessment once and share it with as many future partners as desired. Assessors get validated assessments back faster while eliminating countless hours chasing assessments.
