 Not marked as obsolete by the IEEE.
  Commercial products sold today still support WPA-TKIP.
  We still see a large support rate for WPA-TKIP in our Wi-Fi surveys.

Background.

TKIP Header
 Michael MIC provides better integrity protection than the ICV.
  Covers plaintext data, destination and source address, and priority. 
  Added to the last fragment.

 TKIP Sequence Counter (TSC) for replay protection.
9

TKIP Countermeasures
 Michael MIC is invertible (Wool, 2004).
  Countermeasures state what to do if an invalid Michael MIC is received.

 Client transmits a "Michael MIC Failure Report".
  Access Point blocks TKIP traffic if two are received in one minute.
  After one minute, clients may reassociate and negotiate fresh keys.
10

Quality of Service
 Defined in the IEEE 802.11e amendment (2005).
  Provides eight different channels for different QoS needs.

 Michael MIC covers this channel number (i.e. priority).
  TKIP Sequence Counter (TSC) for each channel.
  For example, used when making phone calls over Wi-Fi.
11

The ChopChop Attack
 The ChopChop attack originally targeted WEP (KoreK, 2004).
  Repeatedly chop off the last byte, and make corrections for the ICV.

 Due to CRC linearity, ICV can be reconstructed if plaintext is known.
  Beck and Tews presented a ChopChop attack against WPA-TKIP (2009).
12

Chopped Byte.
14

Chopped Byte. Guess for all 256 plaintext values of chopped-off byte.
15

Chopped Byte. Guess for all 256 plaintext values of chopped-off byte. Invalid message, if ICV Correction guessed incorrectly.
16

Chopped Byte. Guess for all 256 plaintext values of chopped-off byte. Valid message, if ICV Correction guessed correctly.
17

Chopped Byte.
Guess for all 256 plaintext values of chopped-off byte.
Valid message, if ICV Correction guessed correctly. We now successfully decrypted the chopped-off byte!
18

How to detect a valid ICV Correction?
That is, having correctly guessed the plaintext value.

How to detect a valid ICV Correction?
That is, having correctly guessed the plaintext value.
Side-Channels!

Side-Channels
 We want side-channels allowing us to detect if a TKIP frame is accepted.
  Can we craft TKIP frames that influence the state of its receiver?
  If so, can we find a way to detect the state change?

 We will analyze WPA-TKIP implementations to find such side-channels.
  Allowing us to perform a ChopChop-like attack.
21

Methodology
 Inspect full Wi-Fi stack, looking for:
  Implementation of countermeasures.
  Side-channel vulnerabilities.
  Logical bugs.
22

Results
 Our approach resulted in novel (cross-layer) side-channel vulnerabilities.
  Making use of some of the following features:

 Power Management.
  Fragmentation.
  Hardware Decryption.
23

Power Management
 IEEE 802.11e defines power save delivery and notification mechanisms.
  E.g., Unscheduled Automatic Power Save Delivery (U-APSD).
  E.g., Block Acknowledgements.

 Clients can indicate going to sleep, and wake up any time:
  Requesting new data using a Power Save Poll (PS-Poll) frame.
24

Power Management
Setting power-management flag in its Frame Control (FC) field.
25

Power Management
Setting power-management flag in its Frame Control (FC) field.
26

Power Management
27

Power Management
 Side-channels may abuse these power management features:
  Spoofing target client to enter Power Save mode, then request data.

 Affects Linux kernel version 3.11 and lower.
  Devices supporting WPA-TKIP are arguably running on older versions.
  We will soon see another side-channel for newer kernel versions.
28

Power Management Side-Channel
MITM is not required.
30

Power Management Side-Channel
Set Power Management bit: we want AP to enter PS-mode.
31

Power Management Side-Channel
Set Power Management bit: we want AP to enter PS-mode. Set Fragmentation Number: bypasses Michael MIC verification.
32

Power Management Side-Channel
Set Power Management bit: we want AP to enter PS-mode. Set Fragmentation Number: bypasses Michael MIC verification. Change QoS Traffic ID (TID): bypasses TSC verification.
33

Power Management Side-Channel
Set Power Management bit: we want AP to enter PS-mode. Set Fragmentation Number: bypasses Michael MIC verification. Change QoS Traffic ID (TID): bypasses TSC verification. If ICV constructed correctly, the AP will enter PS-mode.
34

Power Management Side-Channel
Power-Save Poll: request buffered data.
35

Power Management Side-Channel
Failure: AP did not enter PS-mode.
36

Power Management Side-Channel
Success: AP entered PS-mode.
37

Attacker modifications to replayed frame.

Success: client registered in PS-mode.

Power Management
 Bypasses all existing TKIP Countermeasures.
  E.g. Michael MIC Failure Reports, increased rekeying interval.

 Recovers the Michael MIC key (message authentication) in 1 to 4 minutes.
  Much faster than previous attacks, needing 7 to 8 minutes. 
  Due to not relying on TKIP's Michael MIC Failure Reports.
42

Fragmentation
 Side-Channel abuses fragmentation features in MediaTek devices.
  Fragmented WPA-TKIP frame with valid ICV clears fragmentation cache.

 If the ICV is wrong, the frame is silently dropped (cache unaffected).
  If the ICV is correct, the cache is cleared (cache affected).
  Proof-of-Concept with fragmented ARP-Request.
43

Fragmentation Side-Channel
Fragmented message, e.g. ARP-Request.
44

Fragmentation Side-Channel
Set Fragmentation Number: bypasses Michael MIC verification. Change QoS Traffic ID (TID): bypasses TSC verification.
45

Fragmentation Side-Channel
Set Fragmentation Number: bypasses Michael MIC verification. Change QoS Traffic ID (TID): bypasses TSC verification. If ICV constructed correctly, the AP will clear fragment cache.
46

Fragmentation Side-Channel
Dropped or reassembled, depending on fragment cache.
47

Fragmentation Side-Channel
Failure: AP did not clear cache.
48

Fragmentation Side-Channel
Success: AP cleared cache.
49

Hardware Decryption
 Investigate the hardware decryption features of Wi-Fi chips.
  Some drivers drop incoming frames if hardware decryption failed.

 For example, due to an incorrect ICV.
  Frames only forwarded if ICV is correct, potentially leaking information.
50

Return of Power Management
 Hardware decryption performed before OS handles power management.
  Flags inspected only when hardware decryption succeeded.

 Works against Linux 3.12 and higher if hardware decryption is enabled.
  Unlike previous side-channel, which worked on Linux 3.11 and lower.
51

Return of Power Management Side-Channel
Dropped if ICV is incorrect.
52

Return of Power Management Side-Channel
Same technique as earlier.
53

Return of Power Management Side-Channel
Failure: AP did not enter PS-mode.
54

Return of Power Management Side-Channel
Success: AP entered PS-mode.
55

Hardware Decryption
 Investigation reveals several new (similar) side-channels and attacks.
  Linux Power Management, Retransmission Detection.
  OpenBSD Block Acknowledgement, Fragment and Replay Attack.

 See our white paper for more details.
56

Let's Summarize: - We can decrypt frames. - Numerous Side-Channels.

Cool! Now, what is the impact?

Recall TKIP Header
Slide 9
 We now have a means for decrypting one byte at a time.
  Decrypting the last 12-bytes of a frame reveals the Michael MIC and ICV.

 Recovers Michael MIC key since the algorithm is invertible (Wool, 2004).
59

We want more keystream!
 Allows us to inject messages.
  Michael MIC recovered after first message.

 Then, an adversary needs to decrypt the last 4-bytes (ICV) only.
  Quickly learn keystream by making educated guesses for data contents.

 E.g., most bytes of an ARP-Reply are known thus brute-forced quickly.
60

Impact
 We have now obtained keystream and the Michael MIC key.
  Allows us to decrypt, and inject, network traffic:

 The Michael MIC key can be used for decryption using a Michael Reset
Attack (Vanhoef et al, 2013).

 Forged messages are injected into QoS channels with a lower TSC
(Tews et al, 2009; Vanhoef et al, 2013).
61

How is this an improvement?

Improvements
 We bypass all existing TKIP Countermeasures. 
  Consequently we do not rely on any of them either.

 E.g., related work relies on Michael MIC Failure Reports.
  As a result, our decryption techniques are significantly faster.

 Recovery of Michael message authentication key in 1 to 4 minutes.
63

Countermeasures to our Attacks
 Our side-channel attacks bypass all existing countermeasures.
  E.g., short rekeying interval, delayed or disabled failure reports.

 We can further reduce rekeying interval, or try to fix an outdated protocol:
  E.g., software changes to process reassembled frames only.


64

Countermeasures to our Attacks
 Our side-channel attacks bypass all existing countermeasures.
  E.g., short rekeying interval, delayed or disabled failure reports.

 We can further reduce rekeying interval, or try to fix an outdated protocol:
  E.g., software changes to process reassembled frames only.

 Or... let us simply disable WPA-TKIP and move on to better protocols.
65

What about WPA2-CCMP?

CTR mode with CBC-MAC Protocol
 WPA2 with CCMP uses an AES block cipher in counter mode.
  CCMP MIC (CBC-MAC) is calculated over every frame.

 Unlike TKIP MIC, where Michael MIC is transmitted in the last fragment.
  CCMP MIC is not known to be invertible.

 Unlike TKIP's Michael MIC (Wool, 2004).
  CCMP has no ICV.
67

CTR mode with CBC-MAC Protocol
 Immediately verifies for data integrity and data origin authentication.
  Unlike TKIP, which for example carries Michael MIC in last fragment.

 Our side-channels work against WPA-TKIP because:
  Operations are performed on decrypted but unauthenticated data.
  Decrypted frames are processed before being reassembled.
68

Demonstration.

Slide 37 70

Failure: client not registered in PS-mode.

Success: client registered in PS-mode.

Failure: client not registered in PS-mode.

We decrypted the previous byte, so we can chop off another one.

Conclusion
 Large support for WPA-TKIP.
  We found several novel side-channels in WPA-TKIP implementations.

 Implementing WPA-TKIP without side-channel vulnerabilities is hard.
  We should do more cross-layer analysis to find vulnerabilities. 
  Hopefully we accelerate the process of deprecating support for WPA-TKIP.
