A good security architecture can kill online fraud

Objective
...to show you how to avoid single-point-of-failures (SPOFs) and prevent fraud
What is a single-point-of-failure? One place, which compromises the whole security if hacked.

What's behind most fraud online? ..... a fundamentally broken nature of identity online...

US government approach to this problem: sneaky surveillance

Chinese government approach to this problem: Real ID online

What's needs to be done to kill fraud?
1. Identity: Our learnings from fixing the online identity 2. Communication: Applying the principles to security of TLS

Why should you even listen to me?
ADUCID (The world's most advanced authentication system)
Our background:
 > 20 years of experience in IT security  We helped shape the standard for digital identities in the European Union
Our products:
 10 years of unique research in authentication & secure communication  7+ million USD in direct investments  7+ international patents  several rounds of penetration tests without a single relevant weakness

2 key design principles & 6 main tools:

1. Remove the people from security

2. Fix the architecture instead of "plugging holes"
 Separate cyber IDs  Asymmetric cryptography  Mutual trust  Distributed design  Dynamic protections  Dual authentication

REMOVE USER

How much of security do users handle?

1. Create strong passwords

2. Never reuse passwords 3. Change password frequently

Can any person do all that?

4. Make sure communication is secure

5. Recognize fake websites & phishing 6. Recognize fake calls or fraudsters

Who should be doing that?

7. Make sure all apps, systems and devices are up-to-date

8. Fight against viruses

9. NEVER EVER make a mistake

Why is it a problem to use physical identity online?

It's expensive to recover (e.g. issue a new payment card)

Physical IDs have a low entropy

Physical IDs limit privacy

Cyber IDs are asymmetric and never leave user's hands. No hack on server or communication can compromise user's cyber ID

Is this service who it claims to be?

MUTUAL TRUST

Online world

Asymmetric cyber ID My app handles security
Server must authenticate to the App

No user or App proves its identity until the server proves its identity the user/App. AND! This is HTTPS independent and largely quantum resistant.

Distributed architecture is like internet, with no single point of failure

Absolute user simplicity. Ultimate network security. Foundation of accountability.

Are the Apps/devices a single-point-of-failure for individual users?
what should we do about it?

Local locks or data encryption?
still a single-point-of-failure bad for user experience bad for recovery process static protection reliant on the user

What about specialized HW chips, smartcards or USB keys?

DYNAMIC PROTECTIONS

Online world

Sandboxing & protections by OS

Multi-level HW footprint

Window of opportunity limited by the user's next login
Sharing of security events between services

Dynamic protections make misuse very hard

We need a security solution, which:
 is dynamically enforced  dynamic in time  not limited by user's abilities  never stores secret on the device  cannot be stolen from the server
Sounds impossible?

DUAL AUTHENTICATION

Online world

1. PIN 1234

3. Encrypt #2

1-way functions

4. Decrypt #2

2. App translates PIN into 3141592 ....9937510582

5. Self-encrypt 3141592 ....9937510582
into

6. Forget all the secrets except of ...

function

Factors are never stored and never sent.

Their "cyber ID" (#2) can change over time. Only the server can evaluate the correctness of a factor.
