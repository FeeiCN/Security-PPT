Previous Research: BadBluetooth
 Require a malicious app with Bluetooth Permission has been installed on the victim's Android phone.
 PBPA and MAP require the Bluetooth device to be initiator and the phone to be the acceptor, which is opposite to the attack flow. This make the attack less stealthy.

What can BlueRepli do?

for almost all Android phones
 Only one interaction with the victim
 The attacker can make this interaction very deceptive.

for a well-known manufacture (may be affected 100 million devices)

Should we based on RaspberryPi ?

Linux

No battery support. Low integration, jumper wire everywhere. HDMI is not a good idea for portable device. SPI is too slow for higher resolution LCD panel. We just want a challenge.
