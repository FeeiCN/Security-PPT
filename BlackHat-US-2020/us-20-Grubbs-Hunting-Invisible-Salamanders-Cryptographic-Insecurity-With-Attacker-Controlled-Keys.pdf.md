This Talk
Intended audience: those who design, implement, and use cryptography. Others will find talk interesting and enjoyable but may lack some context.

This is a talk about cryptography. Some of the slides involve math.

This symbol: if you don't understand all the details, don't worry about it!

Authenticated Encryption

Cat Picture
???

Agree on random key
Encrypt message with using authenticated encryption (AE)
(Galois/Counter Mode, Chacha20/Poly1305)
Core of protocols like TLS, IPSec, SSH

If key is random + hidden: AE hides cat pictures, prevents modifications

4

New Settings, New Needs
Attacker Message

Attacker chooses key(s)
Encrypt message with using authenticated encryption (AE)
(Galois/Counter Mode, Chacha20/Poly1305)
Increasingly important setting for AE:
 Password-Based Encryption/PAKE  E2EE Group Messaging  Abuse Reporting in Encrypted Messaging

Key isn't random + hidden! What security do we need? What security do we expect?

Describe "attacker-controlled keys" setting + examples, explain committing security property AE needs
Many widely-used AE schemes are not committing: can break for GCM, ChaCha20/Poly1305, others
Attacks resulting from non-committing AE:

Attacker-Controlled Keys
Cat Picture

is hidden, has lots of randomness

Try to learn message or change decryption output

Attacker Message
Message and encryption key both chosen by adversary
8

Example: Password-based AE

They're using password1!
123 456

Guess Can't decrypt!

...

password1

Guess Decryption succeeded!

password1

Brute-force feasible if key is not very random (e.g. password/PIN) or if side channel leaks key bits

If attacker doesn't know decryption key, can learn using (online)
brute-force attack

9

Example: Reporting Plaintexts

Can't let the auditor see records...

Fraudulent Records

Attacker chooses encryption and decryption key: tries to lie about ciphertext contents

Auditor

AE.Decrypt(

, ) Fraudulent Records

Decrypt outputs something other than fraudulent records

10

Committing Security for AE

Useful to imagine AE as a lockbox

Intuition holds for hidden random key:
 Can't see inside (confidentiality)  Can't change contents (integrity)

???

No matter the key, only one thing can come out when it's unlocked

11

Committing Security for AE

Useful to imagine AE as a lockbox

Intuition holds for hidden random key:
 Can't see inside (confidentiality)  Can't change contents (integrity)
Without this, AE lockboxes could unlock many ways...

Committing security binds attacker to a single AE decryption, prevents invisible salamanders in ciphertexts

12

Reporting Salamanders
Committing AE

If AE is committing, attacker can't lie about plaintext by
choosing different key

Auditor

AE.Decrypt(

,

Committing AE

)

Decrypt fails - can't report salamanders

Uses AES-CTR + message authentication code (MAC) to prevent tampering

Colliding GCM's MAC

MAC is polynomial evaluation + XOR.

Fast but not collision-resistant (cf. SHA-256)

IV

1. Split ciphertext into blocks (coefficients) 2. Compute hash point (H) and pad (Pad) 3. Evaluate polynomial at H, then XOR Pad
(`len' is encoded ciphertext length)

MAC( , IV

):

1. C1 = Blocks(

)

2.

H = AES( , 0) Pad = AES( , IV )

3.

Tag = C1*H2 + len*H + Pad

Tag

17

Colliding GCM's MAC

Tag is a "simple" algebraic function of ciphertext:

solve one equation to collide for two keys

IV

1. Choose any IV 2. For key , derive H1, Pad1 3. For key , derive H2, Pad2 4. Set tag equations equal, solve for C1:
C1*H12 + len*H1 + Pad1 = C1*H22 + len*H2 + Pad2
5. Let Message be C1 , recompute Tag 6. Output IV Message Tag

MAC( , IV

):

C1 = Blocks(

)

H = AES( , 0)

Pad = AES( , IV )

Tag = C1*H2 + len*H + Pad

Tag
Not true for collision-resistant
hashes like SHA-256

C1*(H12 + H22) = len*(H1 + H2) + Pad1 + Pad2 C1 = [len*(H1 + H2) + Pad1 + Pad2]*(H12 + H22)-1

2x = 6 x = 3

One equation, one unknown!

Can even collide many (>>2) keys: use interpolation

Partitioning Oracles

123 456
password1

...

Guess Can't decrypt!
Guess Decryption succeeded!

Use of non-committing AE with passwords can lead to partitioning oracles: speedup for online brute-force key recovery for AE

password1 29

123 456
password1

Partitioning Oracles
Guess Decryption succeeded! Check two guesses with one ciphertext

password1

Use of non-committing AE with passwords can lead to partitioning oracles: speedup for online brute-force key recovery for AE
Worst-case exponential reduction in guesses! E.g., one million passwords = only 20 guesses

Found partitioning oracle attacks on:  Shadowsocks UDP proxying  Incorrect OPAQUE prototypes Latent vulnerabilities elsewhere
30

Preventing Invisible Salamanders
Committing AE schemes do exist! E.g., CTR-then-HMAC (done correctly) Not standardized, nor widely available in libraries
(also can be less efficient than non-committing AE)
Needed only if attacker-controlled keys are part of threat model
