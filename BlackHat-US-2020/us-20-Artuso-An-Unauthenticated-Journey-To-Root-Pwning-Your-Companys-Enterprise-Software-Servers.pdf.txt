End-user Experience Monitoring (EEM)
 What: Web application running in SolMan's webserver.  Goal: Evaluating availability and performance of systems from
client side.  How: Mimic end-user activities with automated scripts. These
scripts are uploaded to the EEM and later deployed to the EEM robots. SMD agents are EEM Robots by default.  old(UxMon) = EEM.
