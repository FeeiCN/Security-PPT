Information Risk Insights Study (IRIS) 20/20
Objective: Provide data-driven models for better estimating the loss side of the risk equation. Data Source: Advisen's feed of over 100,000 publicly discoverable breach events. Study sample: Ten year history (2010-2019) with over 56K events with breach data.

Looking at Policy Through the IRIS
 SMB impacts
 Small firms have rare, but disproportionate losses
 Losses are not evenly distributed
 Most of the time, losses are not material  The heavy tail of losses is rare, but real
 Regulatory impacts
 Disclosure laws
 Cyber insurance
 Catastrophe modelling rises in importance

Ripples Across the Risk Surface
Objective: Understand the frequency and impact of multi-party cybersecurity incidents, most common due to vendor security compromise Data Source: Advisen's cyber loss database containing 92,000 cyber events collected from publicly verifiable sources Study sample: Multi-party incidents (aka "ripple events")
 813 unique ripple events identified in dataset.  5,437 organizations impacted by 813 ripple events.  Range of 3 to 131 firms impacted in each ripple event

Losses Are Not Limited To Primary Victim

Multi-Party Events Becoming More Common

Ripple Events Amplify Downstream Victims

Sectors Don't Generate/Receive Ripples Equally

Downstream Victims Disproportionately SMBs
8% of central firms in ripple events have less than 10 employees. 17% of downstream firms have less than 10 employees.

Implications of Poor 3rd Party Risk Models
 3rd party risk "policy" mainly protects sourcing firms FROM suppliers
 We've shown multi-party incidents disproportionately impact downstream, especially smaller, suppliers.
 Is there a more equitable and effective approach to managing risk for the entire supply chain?
 Research suggests a type of "Bullwhip Effect" for 3rd party risk
 Info sharing mitigates bullwhip effect in supply chain risk management.  Can more aggressive info/intel sharing help reduce 3rd party cyber risk?
 Recognition of data breaches as a form of negative externality has driven development of consumer data privacy policy and regulation
 Negative externalities not only impact consumers but also downstream firms  How would this look/work applied to multi-party incidents?

Conclusions

The Failure of Policy
The burden of regulation affects smaller firms more than larger firms  Larger firms seem to be successful in containing costs of breaches  Smaller firms disproportionately affected
Disclosure laws  Punitive environment for disclosing breaches
Policy and contractual remedies for breaches  Nature of remedies are based on bad models

...and How to Fix It
Specialization of security concerns  Don't roll your own crypto, or make your own POS system  Firms will respond to regulatory regimes We need better risk models to inform policy

Better Risk Models with Better Data Science
1. Collect better data
a. Disclosure laws based on learning rather than shaming b. Fund and consolidate public sources of security data
2. Build better models
a. Our field is beset with overly simplistic and unvalidated models in which we place far too much trust
b. Many (like a flat cost per record for breaches) don't even pass cursory analysis, yet become tenets of our knowledge base
3. Conduct better research
a. Reading industry reports often gives a sense that authors are more interested in promoting than learning
b. Consume research with more skepticism c. Create research with more curiosity d. "Reward" organizations that produce solid research
