Background: Who's the Sender?

SMTP envelope

HELO helo.sender.com

The user who transmitted the

MAIL FROM: <s@mfrom.sender.com>

message (usually not displayed)

RCPT TO: <bob@email.com>

The user who composed the

From: Secure Bank <noreply@bank.com>

message (Visible to the end-

To: Bob <bob@email.com>

user)

Subject: Account Alert: Suspicious Purchase

The original SMTP has no built-in authentication mechanism  Anyone can spoof any identity in HELO/MAIL FROM and From

Three Sender-Authentication Protocols
 Sender Policy Framework (SPF, RFC 7208)  verifying the IP address of the sending domain
 DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM, RFC 6376)  verifying the email is signed by the sending domain
 Domain Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC, RFC 7489)  "how to" policy for recipient based on SPF and DKIM  "fix" the alignment problem of SPF and DKIM
8

Sender Policy Framework (SPF)

1 Publish authorized IP lists via DNS
DNS
a.com TXT 1.2.3.0/24

HELO a.com MAIL FROM: <s@a.com> RCPT TO: <bob@b.com>
From: Alice <alice@a.com> To: Bob <bob@b.com> Subject: Hello from Alice
Dear Bob,
I'm Alice...

2 Query the domain in HELO and MAIL FROM to obtain the IP lists
3 Check if the sender's IP matches the IP lists  If yes, SPF pass
DNS
a.com TXT 1.2.3.0/24

MUA Alice

Sending Services 1.2.3.4

DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)

1 Publish public key via DNS
2 Generate DKIM-Signature with private key and attach it to the message.
DNS

HELO ehlo.a.com MAIL FROM: <s@mfrom.a.com> RCPT TO: <bob@b.com>
DKIM-Signature: ...;d=a.com; s=any;...
From: Alice <alice@a.com> To: Bob <bob@b.com>

What's Wrong with SPF/DKIM?

From: Alice <alice@a.com> To: Bob <bob@b.com> Subject: Hello from Alice
Dear Bob,

What SPF verifies
What DKIM verifies What the end-user sees
Neither SPF nor DKIM validate the From header that is displayed to the end-user.

11

Domain Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC)

3 Receiving services perform identifier alignment test to check if the domain in From header matches SPF or DKIM-verified domain.
 Exactly match (strict) or have the same registered domain* (relaxed, default mode)
4 The email passes DMARC authentication if: 1) either SPF or DKIM show a positive result, and 2) the From header domain passes the alignment test.

1 publish policy via DNS

Inconsistencies between different components could lead to security vulnerabilities.
16

Exp. 1: Inconsistencies b/w SPF and DMARC

SMTP defines multiple identifiers
 HELO and MAIL FROM
SPF (RFC 7208)
 Check both HELO and MAIL FROM  If either fails, SPF fails
DMARC (RFC 7489)
 Use MAIL FROM for alignment test.  If MAIL FROM is empty, use HELO

HELO attack.com MAIL FROM: <any@bank.com>
From: <sec@bank.com> To: <victim@victim.com>
Dear Customer,
We are writing to...

Ambiguity: SPF uses HELO, and DMARC uses MAIL FROM

17

Exp. 1: Inconsistencies b/w SPF and DMARC

Ambiguity: SPF uses HELO, and DMARC uses MAIL FROM

HELO attack.com MAIL FROM: <any@notexist.bank.com>
From: <sec@bank.com> To: <victim@victim.com> Dear Customer,
We are writing to inform you that...

1 SPF cannot verify MAIL FROM, and can only verify HELO  the non-existent domain doesn't have SPF policy, yet not considered as FAIL
2 DMARC uses MAIL FROM  because MAIL FROM is not empty
3 SPF pass, DMARC pass

18

Exp. 2: Inconsistencies b/w DKIM and DNS

Ambiguity: What DKIM uses differs from what DNS queries

HELO attack.com MAIL FROM: <any@attack.com>
DKIM-Signature: ...;d=bank.com; s=attack.com.\x00.any;...
From: <sec@bank.com> To: <victim@victim.com>
Dear Customer,
We are writing to inform you that...

1 Attacker signs the message with his private key and sends the message
2 When receiving the message, DKIM use `attack.com.\x00.any._domainkey.bank.com' to obtain the public key
3 But DNS takes \x00 as a terminator, and obtains public key from attack.com
4 DKIM pass, DMARC pass

19

Exp. 3: Authentication Results Injection

Ambiguity: Exploiting how SPF/DKIM forwards results to DMARC

RFC 8601 define Authentication-Results header for communicating

results between SPF/DKIM and DMARC

Comments

Authentication-Results: example.com; spf=pass smtp.mailfrom=sender@sender.com; dkim=pass (1024-bit key) reason="signature ok" header.d=sender.com;

DMARC extracts "smtp.mailfrom" and "header.d" to check alignment with

From header.

20

Exp. 3a: DKIM Authentication Results Injection

HELO attack.com MAIL FROM: <any@attack.com>
DKIM-Signature: ...; s=selector; d=bank.com(.attack.com;...
From: <sec@bank.com> To: <victim@victim.com>
Dear Customer,
We are writing to inform you that

1 Attacker signs the message with their private key
2 DKIM verifies the message with the attacker's public key from `selector._domainkey.bank.com(.attack.com' and generates:
Authentication-results: bank.com; Comments
dkim=pass (1024-bit key) header.d=bank.com(.attack.com;
3 DMARC parses the content after the "(" as a comment, and uses bank.com to check alignment with From header
4 DKIM pass, DMARC pass
21

Exp. 3b: SPF Authentication Results Injection

HELO attack.com MAIL FROM: <any@bank.com.(attack.com>
From: <sec@bank.com> To: <victim@victim.com>
Dear Customer,
We are writing to inform you that...

 SPF verifies bank.com(.attack.com
 DMARC uses bank.com to check alignment with From header
 SPF pass, DMARC pass

Attacker can also use single (`) and double (") quotes to replace "(".

22

Exp. 4a: Multiple From Headers

Ambiguity: What receiving server verifies differ from what MUA displays

From: <any@attack.com> From: <admin@bank.com> To: <victim@victim.com>
Dear Customer,...

From: <any@attack.com> From: <admin@bank.com> To: <victim@victim.com>
Dear Customer,...

Attacker Server

Receiving Services
DMARC verifies attack.com

Mail User Agent Victim
MUA display bank.com

 RFC 5322: Messages with multiple From should be rejected  In practice: 19/29 accept (15 use first, 3 use last, 1 show both)
23

Exp. 4b: Multiple From Headers with Space

Three types of variants:
1) _From: a@a.com ; 2) From_: a@a.com; 3) From\r\n_: a@a.com

From : <any@attack.com>
From: <admin@bank.com> To: <victim@victim.com>
Dear Customer,...

From : <any@attack.com>
From: <admin@bank.com> To: <victim@victim.com>
Dear Customer,...

Attacker Server

Receiving Services
DMARC verifies attack.com

Mail User Agent
Victim
MUA display bank.com

24

Exp. 4c: Multiple From Headers with Normalization

Space
From: <any@attack.com> From : <admin@bank.com> To: <victim@victim.com>
Dear Customer,...

Space removed
From: <any@attack.com> From: <admin@bank.com> To: <victim@victim.com>
Dear Customer,...

Attacker Server

Receiving Services
DMARC verifies attack.com

Mail User Agent
Victim
MUA display bank.com

25

Exp. 5: From/Sender Ambiguity

 7/19 MUAs display Sender or Resent-From header value when From header is absent

From : <any@attack.com>
Sender: <admin@bank.com> To: <victim@victim.com>
Dear Customer,...

From : <any@attack.com>
Sender: <admin@bank.com> To: <victim@victim.com>
Dear Customer,...

Attacker Server

Receiving Services
DMARC verifies attack.com

Mail User Agent Victim

Complex From Header Syntax

From: Secure (b@b.com) Bank <@c.com, @d.com: a@a.com (e@e.com) > (f@f.com)
A quick example of valid (!) From header
 Multiple address lists. [RFC 5322]  Encoding: defined to support no-ascii character. [RFC 2047]
From: bob <b@b.com> is equal to From: =?utf-8?B?Ym9i?=<b@b.com> in Base64 encoding
 Quoted-pair: use `\' to escape special characters like `( `. [RFC 5322]

How Prevalent are UI-mismatch Vulnerabilities?
 We tested 10 popular email providers and 19 email clients  43 out of 82 different combinations that could be exploited  What we found only constitutes a subset of the problem

Exp. 7: Spoofing via an Email Service Account

Auth username/pass

MUA Bob

Custom Attackers with an email service account
MUA
- attacker@gmail.com tries to spoof admin@gmail.com

 Sending services should ensure that the From header matches
authenticated username  But From header validation is error-prone because of complex syntax
 We found 7 out of 8 email providers are vulnerable

Exp. 8: Combing Replay and Multiple-From Ambiguity (1/2)

1 Attacker emails himself through the email provider server.

From: <admin@gmail.com> From: <attacker@gmail.com> To: <victim@victim.com>

 MUAs show the first header

Dear Customer, We are writing to inform you that...

Thinking on Defense
 Better parsing and protocol spec
 "Be liberal strict in what you accept"  make protocol implementation-friendly
 simple, well-typed/structured messages, reduce/avoid multiple party processing
 Better UI
 UI needs more explicit security indicators
 For end-users
 Don't blindly trust the email sender displayed in email client  Use end-to-end authentication such as PGP
 PGP may also have parsing ambiguities, but hopefully better than those in SPF/DKIM/DMARC.
