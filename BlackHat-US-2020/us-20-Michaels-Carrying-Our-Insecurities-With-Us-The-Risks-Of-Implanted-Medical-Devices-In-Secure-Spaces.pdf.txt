PED Risk Levels*

Crude guidelines
· Does it have batteries? · Does it have memory? · Does it have sensors? · Can it talk to other devices? · What benefit does it serve?

Low-risk PEDs: · Are without recording or transmission capabilities · Allowed in without mitigation.
Calculators, RX-only pagers, RX-only radio
Medium-risk PEDs: · Have built-in features that enable recording or transmitting text, images/video, or audio · Features can be physically disabled; allowed in with appropriate mitigations.
Dumb phones, airplane mode devices, mics that can be disabled

High-risk PEDs: · Have recording and/or transmitting capabilities that cannot be sufficiently mitigated · May use if mitigation measures reduce the risk to low.
Electronics with RF transmitters (WiFi, Bluetooth, etc), cameras / audio, smart phones

#BHUSA @BLACKHATEVENTS

Proposed Mitigations

 (1) Random Physical Inspections are similar to ICD-705 policy on government provided devices. Poses a low risk to the user; however, without

sufficient knowledge on the specific device, difficult to catch the unauthorized extraction of data.

 (2) Ferromagnetic Detection Systems may help identify smart devices before they enter any secure area, leading to facility manager decision

whether or not to admit the individual. These systems do not prevent data extraction, only the detection of the physical device.

 (3) RF Shielding Apparel could be a foil vest that blocks communication with the IMD. This proposed vest would be worn by the host upon entering

the facility. Signal leakage is still a concern.

 (4) Zeroization is a safe method, but requires knowledge of the device and settings. All sensor data collected inside the SCIF must be removed to

ensure protections. Because of this, a greater risk is imposed upon the user, because stored settings or essential functions may be disrupted.

 (5) Password Activated Software is an administrator controlled software that takes over control of the device and limits suspect functions until a

password is entered. This one-time use password would be provided to the employee after they have left the secure area.

 (6) Temporarily Muting Transducers ensures valuable data cannot be recorded and stored. Users with cochlear implants would lose functionality as

well as other similar styles of implants, many of whose residual capabilities impair human health.

 (7) Personal Jamming actively impairs the communication or sensor functions, much like an

audio white noise generator.

 (8) General Signal Jamming/AP Spoofing hijacks Bluetooth, WiFi, and other commercial signals,

preventing communication to third parties. This proves beneficial as no privacy laws are

violated, yet could result in battery draws or other unintended effects to the medical device.

 (9) Tracking/RF Fingerprint technologies mark an individual and monitor location and possibly

record any signals. Such a technique likely violates privacy/HIPAA laws.

 (10) Denying Entry completely eliminates the risk of data extraction, however the user would

not be permitted to conduct any work within the area. While denial provides security, it fails to

meet the practical needs of our ageing workforce.

Discarded Mitigations
1. Require medical device manufacturers to develop SCIF friendly devices · Only 2% of the population ­ no business case · International manufacturing ­ infeasible
2. FDA require medical device security standards · Likely to occur independent of present discussion · Medical device design is already HARD
#BHUSA @BLACKHATEVENTS

Bottom Line

Policy guidance looking towards future medical technology

Meeting contradictions of security policy, HR policy, health benefits
of IMDs, and truly protecting classified information

Weighing risks/impacts to users and risks to classified information
