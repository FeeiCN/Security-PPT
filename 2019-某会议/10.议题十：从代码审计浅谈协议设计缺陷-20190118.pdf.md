Heartbleed ?

One important part of the TLS/SSL protocols is what's called a heartbeat.
So if a request said it was 40 KB long but was actually only 20 KB, the receiving computer would set aside 40 KB of memory buffer, then store the 20 KB it actually received, then send back that 20 KB plus whatever happened to be in the next 20 KB of memory. That extra 20 KB of data is information that the attacker has now extracted from the web server.

memcpy(bp, pl, payload); memcpy(bp, pl, sizeof(pl)/sizeof(pl[0]));
