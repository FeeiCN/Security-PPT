What  Does  A  Technology  Add--on  Do?  
!  It  is  a  Splunk  App  that  does  Data  PreparaHon  with  followings:  

Data  AcquisiHon  

Inputs  (Files,  Modular,  TCP/UDP,  etc)  

Data  TransformaHon  

Line  breaks,  Hmestamps,  field  extracHon  

Data  NormalizaHon   Data  Enrichment  

CIM  Mapping  (Event  types,  Tags,  aliases)   Prebuilt  panels,  saved  searches,  lookups

TA  Challenges  
Build  a  TA  from  Scratch  is  not  easy,    it  requires  some   trivial  steps  and  different  knowledge  about  modular  
input,  field  extracHon,  CIM,  etc.
