Sparse coding
Sparse coding (Olshausen & Field,1996). Originally developed to explain early visual processing in the brain (edge detection).
Training: given a set of random patches x, learning a dictionary of bases [1, 2, ...]
Coding: for data vector x, solve LASSO to find the sparse coefficient vector a

7/23/2013

48

Sparse coding: training time
Input: Images x1, x2, ..., xm (each in Rd) Learn: Dictionary of bases f1, f2, ..., fk (also Rd).
Alternating optimization: 1.Fix dictionary f1, f2, ..., fk , optimize a (a standard LASSO problem 2.Fix activations a, optimize dictionary f1, f2, ..., fk (a convex QP problem)

Sparse coding: testing time
Input: Novel image patch x (in Rd) and previously learned fi's Output: Representation [ai,1, ai,2, ..., ai,k] of image patch xi.

 0.8 *

Represent xi as: ai = [0, 0, ..., 0, 0.8, 0, ..., 0, 0.3, 0, ..., 0, 0.5, ...]

RBM & autoencoders

- also involve activation and reconstruction - but have explicit f(x) - not necessarily enforce sparsity on a - but if put sparsity on a, often get improved results
[e.g. sparse RBM, Lee et al. NIPS08]

a
f(x) encoding x

a g(a) decoding
x'

7/23/2013

Sparse coding: A broader view

Any feature mapping from x to a, i.e. a = f(x), where
-a is sparse (and often higher dim. than x) -f(x) is nonlinear -reconstruction x'=g(a) , such that x'x

a f(x)
x

a g(a)
x'

Therefore, sparse RBMs, sparse auto-encoder, even VQ can be viewed as a form of sparse coding.

Sparsity vs. Locality

sparse coding local sparse coding
7/23/2013

и Intuition: similar data should get similar activated features
и Local sparse coding: и data in the same neighborhood tend to have shared activated features;
и data in different neighborhoods tend to have different features activated.
56

Sparse coding is not always local: example

Case 1 independent subspaces
и Each basis is a "direction" и Sparsity: each datum is a linear combination of only several bases.
7/23/2013

Case 2 data manifold (or clusters)
и Each basis an "anchor point" и Sparsity: each datum is a linear combination of neighbor anchors. и Sparsity is caused by locality.
