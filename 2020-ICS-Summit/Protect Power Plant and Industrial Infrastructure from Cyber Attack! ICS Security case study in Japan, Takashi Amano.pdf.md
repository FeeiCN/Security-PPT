What is Cyber Resilience?
Ability to Prepare, Mitigate impact, and Response & Recover

Japan Business + IT

Cyber resilience refers to the mechanisms and ability to minimize the impact of a system's cyber-attack and restore it to its original state as soon as possible.
Ref: https://www.sbbit.jp/article/cont1/35866

NIST SP800-160 Vol.2

"the ability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse
conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises on systems that use or are enabled by cyber resources."
RefDeveloping Cyber Resilient Systems : A Systems Security Engineering Approach

UK IT Governance

Cyber resilience is the ability to prepare for, respond to and recover from cyber attacks.
