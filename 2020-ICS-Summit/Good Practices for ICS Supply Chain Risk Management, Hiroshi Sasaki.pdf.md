Security questionnaires for suppliers
 A template for security in the supply chain as baseline  "Requirement" in the supply chain between the manufacturer and the supplier  The answer for the questionnaire would be useful for the Manufacturer to determine
"the supplier's trustworthiness" and "how supplier's in the value chain have the same trustworthiness level"

Supplier B
Trustworthiness :Low

Supplier A
Trustworthiness :High

Online Procurement

Select requirements in RRI questionnaire from CPSF
I Why we had chosen METI CPSF (Cyber Physical Security Framework) as baseline:
 CPSF provides cybersecurity requirements focused on communications between companies and/or organizations categorized as 3 levels,
- The 1st layer ,The 2nd layer, The 3rd layer and six elements (organization, people, component, data, procedure and system).
 CPSF provides informative references of other standards (e.g. NIST CSF and IEC 62443) on each requirement and this information supports our tasks.
 CPSF is enterprise-wide security framework and security requirements are described for each entity in a company.

The 1st layer (Connections between organizations in physical space)

The 2nd layer (Mutual connections between cyberspace and physical space)

The 3rd layer (Connections in cyberspace)

Select requirements in RRI questionnaire from CPSF II. How we had prioritized requirements and selected 15 requirements is:  Security requirements that we have already achieved in our companies.  Security requirements that we require for product/system suppliers at least.  Security controls in operation, management processes and organization. (Technical security controls are out of scope because they depend on products)  High(Policy)-level security requirements in the security risk management process.

II. How we had selected additional requirements is -already implemented by us -appropriate to request the requirements to
suppliers -not technical but managing/operational -not too specific but moderately general

Security requirement

Have you created a list of the hardware and software that make up the system and its management information? And is it properly managed?

evidence


1)Including, but not limited to, an electronic or written list of assets, 2)including asset names, versions, network addresses, administrative responsibility,
licensing information, and locations; operational policies, 3)including transportable media; asset bail line configuration and audit rules; automatic
asset discovery and removal mechanisms; and more.
Assets are identified, listed and prioritized according to their priority.
Implemented Planned to be implemented Not applicable

Example : Answer

Maturity level

Maintain the asset list by regularly reviewing and updating it. Control and limit the use of portable media. Prohibit the removal of highly sensitive data.

Implemented Planned to be implemented Not applicable

The asset list is updated in real time. Regular audits for compliance with the organization's defined baseline structure. A mechanism is in place and operational to automatically detect
 and remove unauthorized assets.
