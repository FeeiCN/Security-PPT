The Chip

What is SIM: for hacker
 Microcontroller
 Own OS  Own file system  Application platform and API
Used in different phones (even after upgrade) OS in independent, but can kill all security
 Baseband access  OS sandbox bypass

What has Karsten taught us?
 There are applications on SIM card  Operator can access you SIM card by
means of binary SMS  Identifier for accessing such
applications is TAR (Toolkit Application Reference)

What has Karsten taught us?
 Not all TARs are equally secure  If you are lucky enough you could find
something to bruteforce  If you are even more lucky you can
crack some keys  Or some TARs would accept commands
without any crypto at all
h;ps://srlabs.de/roocng--sim--cards/  

Getting the keys
 Either using rainbow tables or by plain old DES cracking
 We've chosen the way of brute force  Existing solutions were too slow for us  So why not to build something new?

Getting the keys
 So why not to build something new?  Bitcoin mining business made another
twist  Which resulted in a number of
affordable FPGAs on the market  So...

Now what?
 So you either got the keys or didn't need them, what's next?
 Send random commands to any TARs that accept them
 Send commands to known TARs

Now what?
 Send random commands to TARs that accept them
 Many variables to guess:
CLA INS P1 P2 P3 PROC DATA SW1 SW2
 Good manuals or intelligent fuzzing needed
 Or you'll end up with nothing: not knowing what you send and receive

Now what?
 Send commands to known TARs
 Card manager (00 00 00)  File system (B0 00 00 - B0 FF FF)  ...

Now what?
File system (B0 00 00 - B0 FF FF)
 Stores interesting stuff: TMSI, Kc  May be protected by CHV1 == PIN code

Attack?
 No fun in sending APDUs through card reader
 Let's do it over the air!  Wrap file system access APDUs in binary
SMS  Can be done with osmocom, some gsm
modems or SMSC gateway

Attack?
 Binary SMS can be filtered  Several vectors exist:
 Intra-network  Inter-network  SMS gates  Fake BTS/FemtoCell

Attack?
 Wait! What about access conditions?
 We still need a PIN to read interesting stuff
 Often PIN is set to 0000 by operator and is never changed
 Otherwise needs bruteforcing

Attack?
 PIN bruteforce
 Only 3 attempts until PIN is blocked  Needs a wide range of victims to get
appropriate success rate  Provides some obvious possibilities...

Attack?
 Byproduct attack  subscriber DoS
 Try 3 wrong PINs  PIN is locked, PUK requested  Try 10 wrong PUKs  PUK is locked  Subscriber is locked out of GSM network -
needs to replace SIM card

Attack?
 To sniff we still got to figure out the ARFCN  There are different ways...  Catching paging responses on CCCH feels like
the most obvious way  Still have to be coded  go do it!  Everything could be built on osmocom-bb...

Attack?
 Assuming we were lucky enough
 We do have the OTA key either don't need one
 We've got the PIN either don't need one  All we need is to read two elementary files  MF/DF/EF/Kc and MF/DF/EF/loci  Go look at SIMTracer!

Attack?
 Assuming we were lucky enough  We now got TMSI and Kc and don't need to rely on Kraken anymore
 Collect some GSM traffic with your SDR of choice or osmocom-bb phone
 Decrypt it using obtained Kc  Or just clone the victim for a while using
obtained TMSI & Kc  Looks like A5/3 friendly!  Profit!

DEMO

So?
 Traffic decryption only takes 2 binary messages  DoS takes 13 binary messages and can be done
via SMS gate  There are valuable SMS-packages. Catch the
deal.  There are also USSDs...

"What a girl to do?"
 Change PIN, maybe...  Run SIMTester!  Use PSTN FTW:(  Pigeon mail anyone?
