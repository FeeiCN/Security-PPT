Runa A. Sandvik // @runasand

About me
Things you knew and things you didn't
 From Oslo, Norway  Tested pens in London, UK  Worked for The Tor Project  And Freedom of the Press Foundation  Currently freelancing

What does this have to do with IoT and mobile?

Back in 2010
From the WSJ

Two years later

Just the other day

Something to keep in mind

So why do we do it?

Innovation

And money too

Managing expectations

Creating that baseline

And building on it

Dear journalists

Dear hackers

We can do better

Security versus privacy

While in London

Data has value

Yes, really

Not just $$$

People will do crazy things

Rules of the road

Transparency is key

When pigs fly

Better late than never?

Better late than never?

All you have to do is ask

Where do we go from here?

The real question is...

How do you educate people?

No privacy utopia

We can do what we do best

Stay classy

Not everyone will want your help

Be responsible

It's not all about code

Thanks! Questions?
