The Cybersecurity Mission Statement
"To enable digital transformation through proper IT risk management by making efficient and effective economic decisions supported by evidence and outcome
analysis leading to the strongest cybersecurity program possible."

Digital Transformation (DX) Defined
The application of 3rd Platform and related technologies to fundamentally improve all aspects of society. For business this means:
TRANSFORM...
New sources of innovation and creativity to enhance experiences and improve financial performance. Simply modernizing the technology underpinning existing systems is not transformation.
...DECISION MAKING...
Using information to create an evidence based culture. Companies should plan on doubling the productivity of their knowledge workers by using information more effectively.

...WITH TECHNOLOGY
Digital transformation is not to be confused with digital technologies, however, it does use 3rd Platform technologies such as Cloud, mobility, Big Data, and social as well as Innovation Accelerators including IoT, robotics, and 3D printing.

Distributed Integrity Model (Zero Trust)
 Focused on users, data, and workloads  Virtual elements dynamically tied to the "channels and containers" world of network / operating platform.  Integrity validated by roots of trust or "tethers" that leverage cryptography. TPMs, HSMs, Secure Elements, etc.  As users, data, compute objects travel through channels and containers, they are "traced" through gateways
and across trust zones.

Digital trust enables decisions to be made between two or more entities that reflect their level of confidence in each other; these decisions are based on each entity's digital reputation as well as the risk levels provided by each entity's cybersecurity programs for any proposed digital activity.
