Overview
 What is "Hunt"?  Attacker TTP  Creating a Useful Hypothesis  Case Study
 Detecting Access Token Manipulation

What is "Hunt"?
 Actively searching for malicious activity in the environment that has evaded current in place defenses
 Rooted in the assume breach mentality

Generic Hunt Process

"Generic" Hunt Process Problems
 Gather data
 What data should we collect?  Why are we collecting that data?  SIEMs, like Splunk, are expensive...  Open source alternatives, like ELK, are technically free but cost time
 Hunt for bad
 What are you looking for in the gathered data?  What is "good" activity that can safely be filtered?  How much time do you have to search through the data?  Must balance "Hunting" time with "Investigation" time

Hypothesis Driven Hunting

Hypothesis Driven Hunting Benefits
 Focuses data collection effort  Provides a specific goal for the team  Combats data collection for data collection sake  Helps eliminate "analysis paralysis"  Track hypotheses over time
 What Tactics are you not covering  Identify knowledge gaps that training can help fill  Inform purchasing decisions moving forward

Great, so how do I make a hypothesis?
 This is the focus of the presentation!  We will walk you through how to make a hypothesis that will
actually result in something tangible  Will do a practical demonstration on using this process to create
and execute a hypothesis for Access Token Manipulation

First, what are we looking for?
 Assume Breach
 Tons of organizations have been breached  It's a matter of WHEN not IF a breach will occur
 Focus on post-exploitation activity
 Most in place defenses tools focus on preventing/detecting the initial attack
 Firewalls  Anti-Virus  Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems
 If you can stop the attack before the objective is achieved, the attack is still stopped

MITRE Cyber Attack Lifecycle
https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Main_Page

MITRE ATT&CK Framework
 A body of knowledge for cataloging an adversary activity during the attack cycle
 Similar to how OWASP defines application security vunerabilities  Used as a reference for both offense and defense
 Red Canary's Atomic Red Team Project (https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-redteam)
 Includes Windows, Unix, and MacOS TTPs
 Categories loosely correspond with the attack cycle
 Persistence  Lateral Movement  etc.

MITRE ATT&CK Framework

TTPs: What are they?
 We will explain the meaning of TTPs with an example of a Car  Tactics - The employment and ordered arrangement of forces in
relation to each other
 Preventative Maintenance
 Techniques - Non-prescriptive ways or methods used to perform missions, functions, or tasks
 Changing Oil
 Procedures - Standard, detailed steps that prescribe HOW to perform specified tasks
 Detailed manufacturer's instructions for oil change

Tactics & Techniques
 Tactics
 Sorted by column headers
 Techniques
 Represented by individual entries in ATT&CK matrix  217 techniques currently documented  Windows, Linux, MacOS
https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Main_Page

Procedures
 In the detailed information of each technique specific examples or threats are included as available
 Not all procedures are included, but the data set is large and growing

Why is this useful?
 Focus on detecting the behavior, not hashes and specific tool signatures
 Reference throughout the hypothesis process  Tracking hunt history (technique coverage)  Plan/chart future hunt activity  Identify areas (Tactics) lacking coverage

Enter the Hunt Hypothesis

Our Hypothesis Process
 5 step process to create meaningful hunt hypotheses 1) Identify the Tactic and Technique 2) Identify the Procedure(s) 3) Identify the Collection Requirements 4) Identify the Scope 5) Document Excluded Factors
 Intended to be used to create hunt hypotheses to be completed in one week

Phase 1: Identify the Tactic & Technique
 High level what are you looking for?  Used to track interest (tactics) over time in environment  Attacks rarely use only one Tactic or Technique
 Specifically focus your efforts

Phase 2: Identify the Procedures
 Specific examples and implementations of the selected technique  Frequently found in APT reports, threat intelligence, etc.  Understand and examine the different procedures  What can and cannot be easily changed across all of the
procedures?  Perform research to understand the basic concepts of each
procedure

Phase 3: Identify Collection
Requirements
 Bulk of the research time  Replicate malicious activity in the lab  Identify common behaviors  Identify high false positives
 If possible, test in a small portion of the network
 Should result in a POC collection capability which gathers desired data

Phase 4: Identify the Scope
 Two factors for scope:
 Time
 Length of execution window  We recommend starting with week long execution windows
 Number of data sources to collect
 Can be host or network information  How much data can be collected in the timeframe?  How much data can be analyzed in the timeframe?
 Primarily based on collection requirements  Scope may be limited due to limited collection capability

Phase 5: Document Excluded Factors
 What things were you unable to include in the hypothesis at each level?
 What TTPs were not able to be researched during this hunt?  Technical collection limitations?  Political limitations?  Scope limitations?
 Will feed future hunt hypotheses  Informs future technology purchases  Quantifies the effects of scope limitation

What do we have at the end?
 Specific behavior being "hunted" for in the environment  Understanding of the attack technique  Knowledge of data required to detect the activity

Benefit of this process
 Focuses hunt efforts to have a tangible result  Incremental improvement of security posture over time  Can transition reported attack techniques to real security quickly

Case Study
Detecting Access Token Manipulation

CISO went to Hacker Summercamp
 Our situation:
 Small security budget  No EDR capability (agent-based monitoring)  Poor lateral network visibility  Lots of local administrators
 Our task:
 Can we detect it?  Can we stop it?  Have we been affected by it?
 Our reality:
 Don't want to focus on the Empire specifically, but maybe its capabilities

Phase 1: Tactic and Technique(s)

 Empire is commonly used for:
 Privilege Escalation
 Access Token Manipulation  Bypass User Account Control
 Defense Evasion
 DLL Injection
 Credential Access
 Credential Dumping
 Lateral Movement
 Pass the Hash  Pass the Ticket  Windows Management Instrumentation
 Tactic - Privilege Escalation 1
 Technique - Access Token Manipulation 2

1https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Privilege_Escalation 2https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1134

Access Token Manipulation
 Windows uses access tokens to determine the security context of a running process or thread
 Attackers can manipulate their applied access token to access securable objects or perform privileged operations that they previously were not able to do.
 Procedures
 Token Impersonation (Theft)  Create a Process with a Token  Create Token  Impersonate Token
https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1134

Windows Authentication Overview
 Windows creates a logon session upon successful authentication
 User credentials (if any) are stored in lsass.exe
 Credentials may be used later for Single Sign On
 Credentials are tied to the logon session  Typical credentials: NTLM hash, Kerberos tickets, plaintext passwords
 Tokens define the security context of a process/thread
 When a process/thread wants to act in a user context it uses a token
 Interact with a securable object or perform an action that requires privilege
 Tokens are tied to logon sessions and determine how the cred is used
Thread/Process  Token  Logon Session  Credential

Logon Session Types
 The logon session type is the only thing that matters for credential/token theft
 NOT the token type. Credentials are tied to a logon session, NOT a token!
 Types
 Network logon (type 3): the client proves they have credentials, but does not send them to the server (credentials are NOT in memory)
 Non-Network logon (Interactive/NetworkCleartext/etc.): the client sends credentials to the service (credentials are in lsass.exe)
 Implication:
 If Logon Session Type is 3 (Network logon) then there is no credential/token to steal

What is an Access Token?
 Kernel object that describes the security context of a process/thread
 Contains the following information:
 User Account Security Identifier (SID)  Group SIDs  Logon SID (Logon Session Identifier)  List of Privileges held by user or groups  Token Integrity Level  Impersonation Level  Optional list of restricting SIDs
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa374909(v=vs.85).aspx

Token Types & Impersonation Levels
 1) Primary - a process token
 OS uses token's credentials to authenticate remotely.
 2) Impersonation - a thread token
 Threads use Impersonation tokens to impersonate other security contexts  OS might use token's credentials to authenticate remotely
 Token Impersonation Levels
 Anonymous - Remote server cannot identify/impersonate client  Identification - Remote server can identify user, but not impersonate  Impersonation - The remote server can identify and impersonate the client
across one computer boundary  Delegation - The server can impersonate the client on across multiple
boundaries, and can make calls on behalf of the client.

Access Token Manipulation Overview
 Every process has a primary token that describes the security context of the user account associated with the process
 By default, threads use the process' primary token  Threads can impersonate a client account
 The thread will have both a primary and impersonation token in this case
 Token Impersonation  Create a Process with a Token  Make and Impersonate Token

Phase 2: Identify the Procedures
 Technique - Access Token Manipulation  Token Impersonation  Create a Process with a Token  Make and Impersonate Token

Token Impersonation (Theft)
 Situation:
 Your target user has a non-network Logon Session on the system.
 Assuming admin rights, you can directly impersonate the token.  DuplicateToken(Ex)
 Creates a new access token that duplicates an existing token.1  Can use returned token w/ ImpersonateLoggedOnUser or SetThreadToken
 ImpersonateLoggedOnUser
 Lets the calling thread impersonate a logged on user's security context.2  Works with primary and impersonation tokens.2
 SetThreadToken
 Assigns an impersonation token to a thread.3

Create a Process with a Token
 Situation:
 You want a quick way to create a process with a security context for a different user account.
 DuplicateToken(Ex)
 Creates a new access token that duplicates an existing token.1  Can use returned token w/ ImpersonateLoggedOnUser or SetThreadToken
 CreateProcessWithTokenW
 Creates a new process and its primary thread.1  Process runs in the security context of the user account represented by the
specified token.1

Make and Impersonate Token1
 Situation:
 You have a username and password, but the user is not logged on
 LogonUser
 Set the dwLogonType to LOGON32_LOGON_NEW_CREDENTIALS (type 9)  Creates a NewCredential Logon Session for specified user and password
 Local authentication will use the parent process' user  Network authentication will use the specified user account
 Returns a copy of the new Logon Session's access token
 SetThreadToken
 Assigns an impersonation token to a thread.
