A New Class Of Airborne Attacks Compromising Any Bluetooth Enabled Linux/IoT Device

Ben Seri, Head of Research Gregory Vishnepolsky, Researcher

Agenda
 Airborne Attacks  Brief Bluetooth background  The BlueZ stack on Linux  Remote Exploitation of Linux kernel BlueZ vulns  DEMO

Modern Airborne Attacks

New Attack Vector Identified
 5.3B Devices At Risk  8 Vulnerabilities (4 critical)  Android, Windows, Linux, and iOS  Most serious Bluetooth vulnerabilities to date  No user interaction or authentication required  Enables RCE, MiTM and Info leaks

8 New Vulnerabilities

Demystifying Discoverability
Discoverability is not a prerequisite for establishing a connection
 Bluetooth devices transmit parts of their MAC address over the air (LAP)  Sniffing a single packet enables brute force of the MAC (only 32 options)  Open source tools allow attackers to find "undiscoverable" MACs
(Ubertooth for example)
Ubertooth
$100 range solution

Demystifying Discoverability (continued)
 Sniffing BT packets can be done on standard BT Chips/Adapters with FW modification (not easy, but has been done before)  Can easily be done using certain 2.4GHz transceiver ICs such as nRF24L01+
 Needs to support RX on 1MHz wide channels, with GFSK modulation  Promisc sniffing "trick" by Travis Goodspeed
 $0.7 solution. Our code for nRF24 is on github  https://github.com/armissecurity
NRF24

Demystifying Discoverability (continued)
 A lot of OEMs use adjacent MACs for WiFi/Bluetooth  Use WiFi monitor mode to find nearby Bluetooth devices  Attacker positioned on the same network as victim can also use ARP cache

Untapped, Very Wide Attack Surface

It's complicated...
 Bluetooth Spec is 2822 pages long  Some pages look like this  Endless features and facilities (4 layers of fragmentation!)

BlueZ
 The Linux Bluetooth stack since 2001 (!)  Talks to Bluetooth Controller HW devices  Kernel side implementation of
 H4, HCI event handling  ACL, SCO  L2CAP
 Userland implementation of higher layers
 Bluetoothd daemon  Authentication, Pairing  SDP and BT services (HID, Audio, etc)  Runs as root

L2CAP
 The Bluetooth equivalent of TCP  Reliable connections over ACL packets  Listening "servers" on open "ports"
 Connecting to a port does not require authentication  Each service may request it later
 Lots of obscure QoS features == lots of code == attack surface  L2CAP in BlueZ is implemented in Kernel

Mutual Configuration
 Peers can negotiate parameters during connection establishment phase (e.g. MTU)
 Each side may send multiple ConfigReq and ConfigRsp packets
 The Result in ConfigRsp may also be Unaccept or Pending
 An Unaccepted ConfigRsp will be answered with a new ConfigReq
 Each new ConfigReq/Rsp will hold a reconstruction of the negotiated parameters

Excerpt from Bluetooth Spec, page 1902

Mutual Configuration Cont.

RCE in l2cap_parse_conf_rsp (CVE-2017-1000251)

static int l2cap_parse_conf_rsp(struct l2cap_chan *chan, void *rsp, int len,

void *data, u16 *result)

{

struct l2cap_conf_req *req = data; void *ptr = req->data; // ...

len is the size of rsp. data is the output conf_req buffer, but it's size isn't given here...

while (len >= L2CAP_CONF_OPT_SIZE) {

len -= l2cap_get_conf_opt(&rsp, &type, &olen, &val);

switch (type) {

Each param from rsp is added to the data

case L2CAP_CONF_MTU: // Validate MTU ...

buffer at ptr (and ptr is advanced). However, the bounds aren't checked...

l2cap_add_conf_opt(&ptr, L2CAP_CONF_MTU, 2, chan->imtu);

break;

// ... Parsing and adding other various parameters

}

Excerpt from l2cap_parse_conf_rsp (net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c)

RCE in l2cap_parse_conf_rsp on Linux v3.3-rc1+

switch (result) { case L2CAP_CONF_SUCCESS: // ... break;

The state of the connection needs to be Pending

case L2CAP_CONF_PENDING:

set_bit(CONF_REM_CONF_PEND, &chan->conf_state);

if (test_bit(CONF_LOC_CONF_PEND, &chan->conf_state)) {

char buf[64];

len = l2cap_parse_conf_rsp(chan, rsp->data, len,

buf, &result);

// ... goto done;
Excerpt from l2cap_config_rsp (net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c)

The output data buffer buf is 64 bytes long on the stack :(

Exploit Strategy
 Arrange ability to transmit arbitrary L2CAP_ConfRsp  Overflow something significant on the stack (pointers)
 Buffer must also be a valid L2CAP_ConfRsp  Defeat possible mitigations  Develop a write-what-where primitive  Overwrite usermode-helper commands (to get root shell)  Disable LSM (Linux Security Modules) if needed

Expected Stack Overflow Mitigations
 ASLR  Stack canary (stack protector)  FORTIFY_SOURCE (stack buffers are adjacent to the stack canary)  NX-bit (DEP - Data is not executable, code is not writable)

Real World Kernel Configurations
 No KASLR (practically everywhere)  Stack canaries enabled only in major linux distros
 Not in default config  Almost never used in IoT devices
 Fortify source enabled, stack canary disabled (bad idea)
 Samsung Tizen Watch
 No NX bit (wat?)
 Amazon Echo (sad!)

Case Study #1 - Samsung Gear S3
 Kernel 3.18.14, Arm 64bit  No KASLR  No Stack canaries  Fortify source enabled & stack canary disabled (bad combo)
 First overflown qword is the frame pointer  SMACK (access control)

Case Study #2 - Amazon Echo
 Kernel 2.6.37 (!), Arm 32bit  No KASLR  No Stack canaries  No Fortify source
 First overflown dword is the pointer to the output buffer (response)
 No NX Bit (!)  No Access Control

Linux v2.6.32 Limited RCE Flow

switch (result) {

... case L2CAP_CONF_UNACCEPT:
...

Input configurations are limited in length (60 bytes)

char req[64];

if (len > sizeof(req) - sizeof(struct l2cap_conf_req)) {

l2cap_send_disconn_req(conn, sk, ECONNRESET);

goto done;

}

Output buffer (req) is still

64 bytes on the stack

result = L2CAP_CONF_SUCCESS;

len = l2cap_parse_conf_rsp(chan, rsp->data, len,

req, &result);

...

Getting Out of Bounds

...

while (len >= L2CAP_CONF_OPT_SIZE) {

len -= l2cap_get_conf_opt(&rsp, &type, &olen, &val);

switch (type) {

...

A zero length config element

case L2CAP_CONF_RFC: if (olen == sizeof(rfc)) memcpy(&rfc, (void *)val, olen);

will result in a element added to the output response with it's default length

l2cap_add_conf_opt(&ptr, L2CAP_CONF_RFC, sizeof(rfc), (unsigned long)&rfc);
break;

Getting Out of Bounds [2]

 Our input element:

0x04 == L2CAP_CONF_RFC

Zero len RFC

 Turns into an 11 byte output element

 For example: sending 30 zero-len-RFCs will
overwrite data way out of bounds:
 30 * zero-len-rfcs = 60 (max)  30 * output-rfcs = 330

Stackframe from Amazon Echo v591448720

Analyzing the stack

 ptr points to the next element in the output buffer

l2cap_recv_frame
... (inlined calls)

 Sending 24 zero-len-RFCs will
bring us to overwrite ptr:
 24 * zero-len-rfcs = 48  24 * output-rfcs = 264

stack vars
target buffer - req[64]
stack vars ptr (stack var)
saved registers, saved frame, and return address

 After overwriting ptr, the next parsed element can be written anywhere

l2cap_recv_acldata

previous frame, stack vars

Stackframe from Amazon Echo v591448720

Creating a Write-What-Where Primitive

 24 RFCs won't allow us to control ptr due to alignment
 We need other elements to align our overflow of the ptr
 Using FLUSH or MTU elements can enable proper alignment

Controlling Write-What-Where

 We send 22 empty RFCs
 Additional 2 empty FLUSH elements (for alignment)
 And lastly: We send a FLUSH element (#3) to control lower half of ptr (little endian)
 Now we can write an additional element anywhere on the stack!
 Reminder: ptr is where the next element
is written to.

Control of LR

Packaging an Attack Buffer
 Each ConfRsp command we send allows a Write-What-Where of 2 bytes anywhere on the stack
 Conveniently, L2CAP allows packing multiple commands into 1 packet. This allows sending multiple ConfRsp's at once (essential for overflowing all 4 bytes of LR)
 We'll use that to write a shellcode somewhere on the stack, word by word, and then point LR there (No NX-bit)

Packaging Attack Buffer

Usermode helpers
 We've got Kernel mode code exec. We want a root shell.
 orderly_poweroff function runs a command in userspace that is supposed to shut the machine down gracefully
 poweroff_cmd is a global (writeable) string in kernel memory that holds that command.
 Our payload writes a bash connectback to poweroff_cmd, and then calls orderly_poweroff

Exploit Recap (Amazon Echo)
 Begin an L2CAP connection, with a high MTU
 Inject a crafted packet with multiple ConfRsp's:
 Each ConfRsp writes 2 bytes of payload to an unused area on the stack
 The last 2 ConfRsp's point the LR to the payload
 The payload is a shellcode that overwrites poweroff_cmd and causes a bash command to be executed.
 Finally, it restores execution (jumps back)

Linux 3.18.14 RCE flow
 Performed on Gear S3 Smartwatch
 No limitation to size of ConfRsp on this newer kernel  NX-bit enabled, arm-64, FORTIFY_SOURCE
 But no stack canary... Therefore, we overflow LR directly
 Point LR to a stack pivot, executing a ROP chain from our ConfRsp.
 ROP performs the same usermode helpers trick

Defeating modern mitigations

 On major Linux distros, kernel stack canaries are enabled. Some enable KASLR. However:

static int l2cap_parse_conf_rsp(struct l2cap_chan *chan, void *rsp, int len,

void *data, u16 *result) {

... struct l2cap_conf_efs efs; ...

// <- Uninitialized

olen is attacker controlled, this memcpy can be avoided

while (len >= L2CAP_CONF_OPT_SIZE) {

...

case L2CAP_CONF_EFS: if (olen == sizeof(efs)) memcpy(&efs, (void *)val, olen);

Uninitialized efs (16 bytes from stack) will be leaked to attacker

...

l2cap_add_conf_opt(&ptr, L2CAP_CONF_EFS, sizeof(efs),

(unsigned long) &efs);

Key Takeaways
 Bluetooth implementations are complex and underexamined
 Mitigations in Linux devices (especially IoT) are lagging behind
 Security mechanisms should be monitoring Bluetooth, and other wireless protocols as well
