Cue: Adversary
Д Introduce a realistic* adversary on your network
*an emulated adversary
Д Now you can determine what happens if an attacker gets on your
network Г Did I detect them? Г How far did they get? Г How can I improve my detection and prevention?

Successful Adversary Emulation
Make it real: Use the same techniques, tools, methods and goals of an attacker End-to-End: Don't just look for holes or perform small attacks. Start from the initial compromise and go until objectives are accomplished Repeatable: Be repeatable, so that your detection and prevention improvement (or degradation) can be measured over time

CALDERA Г Conducting an Operation
1.Load the CALDERA shim onto network hosts 2.Create an adversary by giving it capabilities 3.Launch the operation
Д During the operation:
Г CALDERA will report its activities, including artifacts created Г CALDERA will automatically stop if it has exhausted its toolkit
Д After the operation:
Г CALDERA will provide a report of what it did Г CALDERA will automatically "reset" infected hosts, removing artifacts and stopping
processes

Г Targeting, TTP selection, domain inference... Г ... all needs to be fully automated!

The Core CALDERA Idea
Д Move from an explicit, prescribed decision model towards a dynamic,
model-based one
Д Tag actions with semantic execution information:
Г Preconditions specify the requirements that must be true to execute a technique Г Postconditions specify the consequences that will be true after executing a technique
Д No longer need to be explicitly told what to do!
Г Instead, compare the current state to the available actions to determine which are valid
Д Added bonus: planning for the future
Г If I dump credentials now, that can help me execute lateral movement in the future!

Fun With Preconditions
Д Preconditions tell you what you can do
now
Г In chess: can tell you which moves are valid Г Taken further: can tell you which moves are
legal

escalated foothold on a host, we can:
Г Dump credentials Г Add/modify registry keys Г Setup scheduled tasks Г...

Fun With Postconditions
Д Postconditions tell you what will be true
after
Г With preconditions, can chain actions together to plan for the future
Г Can evaluate potential futures to select the best immediate action

Dump credentials and then laterally move Add/modify registry keys and then dump credentials Setup scheduled tasks and then add/modify registry keys ...

The Language of Pre/Postconditions: The Data Model
Д Need a way to logically encode what the pre and postconditions of
techniques are
Г Can specify requirements/consequences by specifying facts over a data model
Д CALDERA's language: objects and typed fields
Г Objects reference commonly used Windows components Г Fields specify properties of objects, restricted by type
Д Constructed by default, some fields may not be defined
