Credential Theft: How do they do it?
Phishing Kits Keyloggers Hijack Behavior Credential Leaks

Negative Consequences Resulting from a Credential Stuffing Attack
Total annualized cost of credential stuffing, excluding fraud, can average more than $6 million
Monetary cost of fraud due to credential stuffing attacks ranges from $546K to $54 million

45 major brand websites Included retail, banking, travel, media, gaming and other industries 24 hour data collection period during September 2017 420 distinct botnet signatures identified 34,225,052 unique accounts targeted
