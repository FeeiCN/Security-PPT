Automation Myths Obscure Reality

Myth: Automation means fewer jobs

Automation should supplement, not replace
 Analysts are being inundated with alerts
 Too much time spent on mundane, repeatable tasks
 Automation should supplement, not replace  Allow analysts to focus on tasks which require human
intervention

Myth: Security it too complex to automate

Start with small, manageable bites

Myth: Automation is dangerous

Best Practices = Best Results

Why Automate?
 Have measurable goals in mind:
 Automate the repetitive, mundane tasks  Decrease time to respond to an incident  Act as a force multiplier for security teams  Respond in a documented, repeatable manner  Reduce risk

Identifying Processes to Automate
 Review all security processes and tools
 Which tools can be easily automated?  Which processes are consistent and predictable?  Which processes are repetitive?  Which processes require little human intervention?  Which processes are taking too much time?

Getting Started
 Small, easy to automate processes  Well documented, well understood processes  Quickly and easily show value  Build out from there...

Human are not the Enemy!
 The goal is NOT to remove humans from the process  Automation and analysts should complement each other  Include human interaction at critical junctions or decisions

Common Use Cases
