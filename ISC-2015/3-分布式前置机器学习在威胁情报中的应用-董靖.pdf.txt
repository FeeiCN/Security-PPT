Situation Awareness
 It's not a matter of simply aggregating all the tactical-level information available. Instead, status information must be correlated to the context of the mission or business, thus exposing the real impact to its operations.
 At the strategic level, it's important to be able to look well beyond simple incident data to identify threat actors, recognize trends in their activities, and expose their malicious objectives.

          
- Too much data? - Data is useless unless it drives decisions.
