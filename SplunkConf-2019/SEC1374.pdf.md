Machine Learning for Security Monitoring: The Project
Project setup  Started Q1 2019  Project staff of four  Intention:
 Can we extend SecMon with ML, to:  Baseline the data center, analyze behaviors?  Find security relevant patterns?

Machine Learning Project Timeline

Frame the Problem
E.g. Detect Anomalous Proxy Traffic

Explore and tune models
Unsupervised approaches first Supervised approaches second
Labels from context info, third

Present and Validate
Interface results, interpret findings. Challenge the model
with simulated attacks / anomalous behavior

Get, explore and prepare data. Add context.
Collect and consolidate all relevant heterogeneous data into a dataset to start modelling work + consider adding context information (labels)

Use Case 1: Proxy Communication

Use Case One: Proxy Communication Idea, Concept, Results
Idea: Can we profile system communications outbound via webproxy and detect changes in behavior to ultimately find unwanted outliers?
Concept  Collect eight features (each by Source IP) onto summary index.  One DensityFunction per feature. | fit every night.  | apply density models in intervals. Historize by again collecting onto summary index.  Dashboard visualizes findings, guides investigation workflow.
Results  Changes are reliably reported.  Findings are consolidated into meta alarms (aka "change of change").  Change caused by unwanted software (HTTP tunneling of SSH traffic) correctly detected.

Use Case One: Proxy Communication Concept Building Blocks: SPL-Foo

Three scheduled Searches:

Search #1: Base Collector and SummaryFiller  Create eight feature fields (dcDstIp, dcDstNetloc, dcCategories, categories, dcUserAgent, UserAgents,
sumBytesIn, sumBytesOut), splitted by _time (1h) and src_ip  Collect onto summary index.

Search #2: Training / Model Fitter  Train one DensityFunction per feature.  Full | fit every night.

Search #3: Alert Generator, Delta Fields Generator and SummaryFiller  AlertGen: Find outliers by | apply 'ing density models over latest timeslice (every few hours).  DeltaFieldsGen: Also cover last month of data to generate additional feature "newUserAgent", via
| streamstats implementing a historybrain.  Collecting again onto summary index, to historize and make available for dashboard.

Use Case One: Proxy Communication Investigation Workflow
1. Derivate Alerts: Act on these
2. Deriving from sum(outliers) (=scoring) per src_ip
3. See anomaly_score trend (per src_ip)

4. Drilldown on specific src_ip: Check outliers by visually presenting base values and its delta
5. Drilldown on specific src_ip: Check raw values

Use Case 2: Identifying System Compromises

Use Case Two: Webserver Monitoring Identify compromises by their behavior
Idea  Can we use MLTK to ease alert fatigue?  Instead of further evolving attack signatures:
Let's find signals that identify successful compromises  A hacked webserver will change its behavior. How?
 Files written where they should not, e.g. Webshell  Webpage or DB table modified  OS Command executed, e.g. cmd.exe ...

Concept

 Use Windows logs (standard and sysmon) to generate features:

 [Webserver: File Written into Webroot by Webserver Worker Process  Classic SPL]

 [All Systems: Lsass CrossProcs  Classic SPL]

 Webserver: Suspicious commands started by webserver worker process ML

 ...

Use Case Two: Webserver Monitoring Find Suspicious Commands started by W3Worker Process
Observations  How can we find unusual command from w3wp.exe?
"unsual" can be tricky, CommandLines have a high variance (e.g. date/time parameter).  Instead, how about suspicious commands? But not every process binary is bad
Need to consider whole CommandLine.  A single command may not be significant enough
Need to consider multiple commands, their sequence.
Concept  Define a list of suspicious words to extract matches from the CommandLine  Collect extracted matches into bag of words pattern of suspicious sequences  Classify malicious sequences:  | fit TFIDF from bag of words  Classify with | fit LogisticRegression from a set of positive examples  Identify malicious sequences with a supervised learning approach  Maintain lookup of positive examples to train and refine the model over time and adapt to new situations

Use Case 3: Baseline Privileged Account Behavior

Use Case Three: Baseline Privileged Account Behavior Idea, Concept, Gain

Idea: Can we profile Windows admin logon sessions and detect changes in behavior to ultimately find suspicious outliers?

Concept  Collect features describing Windows admin logon sessions onto summary index  Cluster training data (last [30;1[ days) using | fit XMeans models every night. One model each for
focusing on source (ip address), session (behavior) and target (host)  | apply models each day to testing data (last day). Historize by collecting onto summary index.  Detect anomalies based on changes in cluster_distances (| fit DensityFunctions and |
outputlookup percXX statistics) and cluster memberships (| outputlookup account to cluster relations)  Dashboard visualizes findings and guides investigation workflow.

Results  Three types of anomalies detected: Source, Target and Session Metadata  Enables detection of credential theft, malicious account usage (e.g. lateral movement), ...  Differentiation between local and global outliers: New accounts trigger only global alerts

Summary, Key Benefits and Takeaways

Key Benefits  New SecMon capabilities:  20 Mio Console Cmds classified every day by machine  Pattern analytics of core infrastructure components: Communications, compromises, privileged accounts  Efficiency gained: Smoother day-to-day ops, more time for use case development.

Takeaways  Classic SPL is here to stay  ML vastly expands SecMon capabilities:
 Allows to look at the "grey" between the black&white  Enables feature-rich use cases  Easy tuning  New data insights may impact project plan. Stay flexible.
