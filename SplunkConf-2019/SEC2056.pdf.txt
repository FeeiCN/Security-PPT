Visibility. Is. Crucial.

Activity Profiles
What should you be looking for in encrypted network traffic
Benign
 Keep sensitive data secure (e.g. web sessions, email, data transactions)
Malicious
 C2/Data exfiltration  Hiding of exploit delivery  Phishing email delivery/reception
Policy
 Sites/activity that aren't malicious, but pose risk to the business (HR, etc...)
Unknown
 Fertile hunting grounds

Technology Overview
#TechGoals

Data
Choose your own adventure
Process Data
 Executable that spawned the process  IPs/hosts the process is connecting to  Hash of the executable
Network Data
 Source/destination IPs  Monitor SSL/encrypted traffic
Signatures for Matching
 Need to consolidate protocol properties to an easily defined signature

Process Data
Carbon Black
Behavioral detection
 Detects applications doing things like scraping memory, key logging, spawning shells, etc
Process and binary search of centralized data
 Hash and behavior based
Process based network activity Live Response remediation
 Allows for host isolation  Allows you to have a terminal shell on the host to kill process, add or delete files, perform mem dumps, etc

Carbon Black Data

Network Activity
Zeek (formerly Bro)
Open Source Network Monitoring tool
Passive IDS
 Can leverage various types of signatures
Scriptable
 Extend network monitoring capability
Logs everything that it sees allowing for forensics
 Common protocols: HTTP, SSL, SMTP, SSH, etc...  Logs can be sent to Splunk

SSL
What is it?
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a server and a client. Uses certificates issued by a trusted CA
 Uses a public private key pair to establish an encrypted connection
Allows for the secure transfer of sensitive information Used over TCP

JA3
What is JA3?
JA3 is a method of fingerprinting SSL/TLS encrypted network traffic. This allows you to identify what is on your network, establish a baseline and alert on anomalous activity
Developed around Lee Brotherston's 2015 research
 Lee's DerbyCon talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX0FRAy2Mec
Allows you to identify what's on your network and establish a baseline
 Identifies potentially malicious activity without having to MITM your encrypted network traffic  Resource: https://engineering.salesforce.com/tls-fingerprinting-with-ja3-and-ja3s-247362855967

Round 1
"JOIN"
Coming from an SQL background and Inner Join seemed like the right solution.
