Use Case Enrichment requires checking the use case concept and refinements against known security indicators and gathering input from security professionals.

Use Case Refinement determines the actual steps to make it a reality. Components like who the threat actor is and what technologies are required must be identified.

The Concept of the Use Case is the problem it is meant to solve. This idea can spring from many different sources.

HOGFISH Threat Actor
Sample threat actor analysis

 2019 SPLUNK INC.

The HOGFISH threat group has been operational since 2009. HOGFISH actors have conducted supply-chain focused attacks, where the initial action on objective is to compromise an MSP in order to subsequently gain access via legitimate, compromised user credentials to their client's networks for exfiltration of sensitive information.

Initial Compromise
 Spear Phishing Campaign  Malware attached to email

Execution
 Powersploit to inject code into PowerShell

Persistence
 Autorun registry keys for malware persistence

Defense Evasion
 Utilized base-64 encoded content

Credential Access
 Mimikatz  pwdump

Discovery
 Used net use to check for connectivity to machines  Scripts to enumerate IP ranges

Lateral Movement
 RDP

1
Monitor for malicious start-up tasks

RECOMMENDED USE CASES
2
Monitor for external emails from unknown domains with attachments

3
Monitor for common hacker tools

Use Case Sample
Sample use case for HOGFISH Persistence

Use Case Name:
Threat Scenario Objective
Stakeholders Tools Data Requirements Logic

Malicious Start-up Tasks
Threat establishes scheduled tasks, startup items or cronjobs to maintain persistence
Prevent competitors and malicious entities from creating malicious start-up tasks to establish malware persistence
SOC
Splunk, Cylance, Carbon Black
Windows, CrowdStrike, Cylance, Carbon Black, CyberArk
Alert on:  Unknown startup items  Unknown cron jobs  schtasks usage  Run registry key changes

Prioritize Use Cases
 How severe is the threat? What is the impact to the business?  Is the required data already available? How difficult will it be to get the required data?  Are there existing compensating controls to prevent this activity?  Do you have existing detection content for similar TTPs?  Are there clear actions to investigate and respond to the use case?
