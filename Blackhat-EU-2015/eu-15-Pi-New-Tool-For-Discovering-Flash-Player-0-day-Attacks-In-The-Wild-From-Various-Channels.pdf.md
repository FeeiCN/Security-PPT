Agenda
 Who am I  Background  Sample Channels  Tool to identify 0-day

Flash Year
 JAVA Click-to-Play  Browsers' UAF mitigations  So Flash Player boom in 2015

Flash Year
 Zero-day attacks' targets are mostly Flash Player in 2015
CVE-2015-0310 CVE-2015-0311 CVE-2015-0313 CVE-2015-3043 CVE-2015-3113 CVE-2015-5119 CVE-2015-5122 ... ...

Flash Year
 In late 2014, I decided to catch Flash Player zero-day attacks in 2015.
 There were two questions need to solve to achieve the goal.

Two questions
 How to get effective samples in the wild?
Try any possible source channel to get effective samples.
 How to identify 0-day from these samples?
Need a processing tool, fast, low false alert.

Agenda
 Who am I  Background  Sample Channels  Tool to identify 0-day

Sourcing Channels
 Channel 1 - Products' feedback
> Large number of SWF samples from products or engines' detection feedback
> Most effective channel

Sourcing Channels
 Channel 2 - URL Crawl
> Several exploits integrated in one URL > Trigger which exploit depends on software version installed in victim's system > Crawl this kind of URLs may catch other software exploits

Sourcing Channels
 Channel 3 - VT intelligence > SWF samples downloaded from
https://www.virustotal.com/intelligence/
> 0-day sample may be submitted to VT before it is discovered

Sourcing Channels
 Channel 4 - URL Pattern
> Exploit Kit or Campaign URLs may have some pattern. > Find these kinds of URLs, visit them to detect

Agenda
 Who am I  Background  Sample Channels  Tool to identify 0-day

Need a tool
 Need a tool to identify SWF files or URLs can exploit target version of Flash Player.
> Low False Alert. > Logger for automation. > Record exploit event when detect. > High performance.

Advanced Flash Exploit Detector(AFED)
 IE BHO written by C++  Hook Flash OCX to detect.  Hook IE event to get current URL name.  Write detections and behaviors to log.

Automation Process
 Simple Python code  Register AFED using regsvr32.exe  Every time load a URL in IE, AFED hook Flash OCX to detect  Kill IE processes to load next URL  When finished all URLs, parse log file with rules

How to implement AFED?
 Before vector.<*> mitigation introduced, all Flash Exploits used corrupted vector.<*> to exploit.

Typical Exploit Flow Before Mitigation
 Simplified Exploit Flow
vectorAllocate(); triggerVulnerability();
findCorruptVector(); buildRopAndShellCode(); execRopAndShellCode();

Detect Flow Before Mitigation
 Ideally
vectorAllocate();
triggerVulnerability();

findCorruptVector(); buildRopAndShellCode (); execRopAndShellCode();

CheckVectorLen(); LogExploit();

Hook JIT
 Almost each AS3 method will be JITed before called  So I hook the JIT point of AVM2  In hook point, check Vector object length

Detect Flow Before Mitigation
 So, Practically
vectorAllocate(); triggerVulnerability();

findCorruptVector(); buildRopAndShellCode (); execRopAndShellCode();

JIT_HOOK();

CheckVectorLen();

Hook JIT
 Key function
> In AVM2(https://github.com/adobe-flash/avmplus), BaseExecMgr::verifyJit is the function to verify and emit native code.

How to check vector length?
 Hook Vector Creating
> Vector.<int>, Vector.<uint>, Vector.<Number> and Vector.<Object> > Template function, 4 instances in flash binary.

How to check vector length?
 Check Vector length before mitigation
> vec_obj_addr + 0x18 is the ListData which save data. > poi(poi(vec_obj_addr + 0x18) ) is vector length

Detect Flow Before Mitigation

 So, Finally
vectorAllocate();
triggerVulnerability();

SaveVectorObj();

findCorruptVector(); buildRopAndShellCode (); execRopAndShellCode();

JIT_HOOK();

CheckVectorLen();

After mitigation introduced
 Use other objects to exploit.
> CVE-2015-7645 used ByteArray based object. > Overwrite ByteArray length to achieve arbitrary read and write. > No general exploit object like Vector

Detect Based on Behaviors
 JIT native code prologues are almost like this:
> Hook first 9 bytes of JIT native code to record each call.

Detect Based on Behaviors
 AFED can get AS3 method name and JIT native code address by hooking JIT.
 So we can get something like this in log:

Heuristic rules based on behaviors
 For example, ByteArray heapspray.
 AFED will print lots of "Call [flash.utils::ByteArray]" to log. Add this rule when parsing the log.
 Other heuristic rule can be added by analysis from recent exploits or experience.
 Recently, exploits also used BitmapData heapspray.

Forget one thing
 Hook Flash OCX loading, like Windbg's module load event.
 Hook CoGetClassObject function in urlmon.dll
 IsEqualCLSID(rclsid, CLSID_Flash) to identify Flash OCX is being loaded or not.
