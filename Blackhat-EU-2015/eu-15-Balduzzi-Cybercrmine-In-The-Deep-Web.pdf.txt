Our research focus

 Infrastructure resilient to LE takedowns

 Marketplaces for cybercrime goods

 Safe haven for information

exchange and coordination

Dark Web

 TOR  I2P  Freenet

Rogue TLDs
 Cesidian Root  OpenNIC  NewNations ...

Custom DNS
 Namecoin  Emercoin

7

Freenet
 Oldest one: summer of 1999 (father of I2P)  Content distribution and discovery, no service hosting  Gossip protocol to lookup a resource (i.e. web page)
8

I2P
 First beta in 2003  Full Dark Net, no anonymous browsing to the Surface Web  Garlic routing: multiple encrypted tunnels, multiple layers
of encryption (transport, tunnel, path)
9

TOR
 First alpha in 2002  Initially used to browse anonymously the Surface Web  Hidden services -> effective Dark Web  Onion routing: multihop routing with with host key
encryption.
10

Namecoins, Emercoins
Blockchain-based domain name server Think bitcoins, but instead of payment transactions, DNS register transaction
Distributed Decentralised No regulating institution
11

rogueTLDs & privateDNSes
Plain old DNS, but with custom servers Custom registrars Custom domains

Malware: Its adoption in the Deep Web
 Modern malware is network-dependent
 @ infection-time: Exploit kits  @ propagation-time: 2nd stage malware  @ operational-time: C&C servers
 Goals :
 Make botnets resilient against LEA operations, e.g. takedowns
 Conceal payment pages  Untraceable money transfers

SkyNet
 Malware with DDoS, bitcoin mining and banking capabilities (쯋-Data/Rapid7)
 ZeuS bot  Bitcoin mining tool (CGMiner)  GPU libraries for hash cracking
 TOR client per Windows  Use /gate.php as landing page to store the
harvested credentials  Path monitoring ....

Vawtrack Banking Trojan
 Spreads via phishing emails  C&C servers (IPs) are retrieved by downloading
the `favicon.ico' icon-file from websites hosted on the TOR network  IPs are steganographically hidden
55

Vawtrack Banking Trojan (cont.)
 Runs `openresty/1.7.2.1' as web-server  Return code on `favicon.ico' is 403 Forbidden
 `ws=`openresty\1.7.2.1' && (`favicon.ico') &&
retcode=403` returns a list of 23:

Ransomware in the Deep Web
 Ransomware seem to love the Deep Web  It provides a hidden and robust "framework" for cashouts
and illicit money transfers
58

TorrentLocker
 A variant of cryptolocker
 Payment page hosted in the Deep Web
 Cashout via Bitcoins
59

TorrentLocker (cont.)

 Records video and audio, suitable for espionage programs
 Detection Feature:  Popularity in the number of values associated
to parameters (in the query string)
62

Automated Detection via ML
63

NionSpy: GET's query string analysis
 xu experienced a quick surge in popularity: 1700+ values

Black Hat Sound Bytes
 We built a system for data collection and analysis in the Deep Web.
 We used it to quickly identify cybercriminal activities, such as trading of illegal goods, underground marketplaces, scams and malware infrastructures.
 We run it operationally and automatically to detect new threats.
