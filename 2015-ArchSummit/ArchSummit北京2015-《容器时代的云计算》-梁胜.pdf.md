Cloud IaaS is not a commodity. Lydia Leong, Gartner

What about private cloud?

Why has OpenStack not succeeded?

The real problem: built it, but nobody came

Private Cloud == vSphere

Where do we go from here?

Docker bursts onto the scene

What is Docker?
 Not a replacement for VM  As an application packaging format, it is similar to JAR, rpm, etc.

JAR WAR
Tomcat (.tgz)

Mysql (rpm)

Linux

JAR WAR Tomcat

Mysql

Linux w/ Docker daemon

You do not have to use microservices to run Docker

Why do people use Docker?

One benefit: higher resource utilization

Load Balancer

App 1.0

App 1.1

VM1

VM2

Load Balancer

App 1.0

App 1.1

VM1

But more importantly: consistent developer experience

Fact: vast majority of Docker users run on AWS

What about PaaS?
Build/Deploy Pipeline PaaS
Private Container Service IaaS

Miraculous growth of DigitalOcean

Simplicity wins

Two ways of automating application management at scale

What container services give us

Manual Application Deployment and Upgrade
Differentiated Infrastructure
Cost without Containers

Automated App Mgmt Commoditized Infrastructure
Cost with Container Services

One Last Thing

Container live migration is coming

Private Container Service

Data Center

Cloud

AWS spot and on-demand instance

Cost of Resources

On-demand instance price

Spot instance price Cloud lightly utilized

Starts to kill and reclaim spot instances
Cloud highly utilized

By monitoring spot instance price, we can know 5-10 minutes in advance that AWS will kill and reclaim spot instances

Rancher and Spotinst work together can save your AWS and GCE bill by 70-90%
