Rationale
Why am I doing this?

Made from 100% recycled plastic.

Isn't a hotel room just a room?
 Room vs. suite vs. villa  Flexible vs. non-refundable rates  Breakfast/dinner/club lounge inclusions  (bonus) Loyalty points  Airport transfers, included event/theme tickets

Data Gathering
Web and app scraping

Reserve engineering APIs/Applications
 Best entry point: mobile apps
 ~30% of hotel chains have mobile-only API  Standard implementation: consumption of mobile website
 Less protection on mobile APIs
 `My HTTP User-Agent string is my password'
 Android better target than IOS
 Easy APK download and static code analysis  Fragmented Android version landscape
 Longer supported APIs

IHG App and mobile website (m.ihg.com)

Reverse engineering APIs

Android app Web browser

HTTP proxy (Burp Suite)

Hotel website

Reverse engineering details
 MITM tool
 Burp Suite (https://portswigger.net/burp)
 Web browser
 Set Burp as http/https proxy  Use User-agent plugin to pretend to be iPhone, Android, ...
 Browse website (e.g http://m.ihg.com)
 Mimic booking process
 JSON parser: http://json.parser.online.fr/

JSON API results
 API calls recorded by Burp show results
 JSON data  Convert results in CSV

Requirements
 Goal
 Command line tool  Make tool obtain data from hotel site(s)  Store data in CSV format or database
 Result set
 Property, date, room, rate, USD price, room classification
 Parameters
 Corporate rates, promo rates, points rates  # of adults, stay duration

Scraper implementation
 Always assume stuff fails
 Overloaded sites  Overload/scraping prevention  Hotels fully booked, not open yet, ...
 My implementation
 One hotel chain per scanner (e.g. IHG, Hyatt, Hilton, ..)  Hotel directory scanner + per-property scanner  Perl WWW::Mechanize  Mimic Android app behavior where possible
 Parallelize everything
 Use HTTP proxies. Assume that stuff fails!

Fail: Fixed API keys in Android apps
 Need to find origin of `strange' strings in network traffic  Bytecode from Android app (extracted using apktool)
const-string v1, "x-client-id" const-string v2, "kTZ6WF" .line 57 invoke-interface {p1, v1, v2}, Lretrofit/RequestInterceptor$RequestFacade;>addHeader(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)V const-string v1, "x-client-secret" const-string v2, "j8G44bDhxIaLNruuf3wR" .line 58 invoke-interface {p1, v1, v2}, Lretrofit/RequestInterceptor$RequestFacade;>addHeader(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)V

More Fails
 No scraping protection at all  Hidden information in apps
 Promotions, secret sign-up bonuses
 Left-over code on site or Android app
 How about passing `X-Environment: staging' along with request?
 Security issues
 No certificate pinning  Clear text authentication  Site returns PIN+credit card numbers

Fun with scraping (Turning it to 11)
 There's a radius parameter on the site
 How about 2,000 miles?
 You can define how many hotels you want in the result set
 How about 5,000?  JSON might be quite big

Implementation done right
 Congrats Marriott!  Mobile app protected with `APIGuard'
 SHA-224 HMAC for all requests
 Website uses Javascript to authenticate requests
 Scrapable, but hard to scale
 Requires JS engine and DOM  WWW::Mechanize::Chrome Perl module works
 See commonMarriott.js requests in your browser

Using scraper data

Finding the needle in the haystack

Issues
 Lots of data  Redundant data  What is a good deal?

Solution: automated discovery
 Find rooms that are cheaper than usual
 Compared to other nights  $ per loyalty point metrics
 Find bonuses
 Points, free meals, SPA treatments, ...
 Find suites that are bookable
 On points  For same price as regular room

Tracking prices visually
 Track price for a certain room and rate combination  Interesting to look at but yields few results

Busy week Same low price for all of 2019

Low weekend rate

Missing price increase for Chinese New Year

Currency mistakes: USD vs MXN
5 USD

Price per point: Find great reward value
 Hotels sell rooms for loyalty points
 Points value changes  Find sweet spots
 Compare cash rates against points rates  Metric: CPP = US Dollar cent per point
 Value of point in USD cent  Referred to as CPM (cent per mile) in air travel realm

Wyndham: Guayaquil (2019-06-29)
0.98 CPP for flexible rate, 0.73 CPP for advance purchase rate

Wyndham: Guayaquil (2019-06-29)
10.26 CPP for flexible rate, ~8CPP for advance purchase

Wyndham: `Stay twice, earn a free night'
 Promotion: Stay 2 nights, get 1 free
 Expired, likely to come back
 Value of free night
 $200-$1500
 Cost of two paid nights:
 E.g. $4, $30  Generally <$100

Great rewards
 Intercontinental Aqaba  All rooms  No longer bookable
 25k points could be purchased for ~$200. Royal Suite sells for >$1200

Newly opened hotels
 New properties lack experience
 Typically load basic rates for all dates  Need to add exceptions for conferences, holidays, ...
 Look for errors
 Suites redeemable for points  Suites for low cash rates  Cheap company/senior/AAA/... rates
 Requirement: detect new properties as quickly as possible

Delayed Opening compensation
 Book a hotel that is about to open  Hope that it's delayed  Demand compensation (loyalty points) when delayed
Starwood/SPG showed opening dates on website

Best Rate Guarantees

Best Rate Guarantees (BRG, BPG)
 `We guarantee the best price for this room and date'
 ... if booked on their site
 Offered by most hotel chains
 Guarantees best price  Drives traffic to site (saving on commission payments)
 Compensation for valid claims
 Price match + 20-25% rebate on rate  Free night  Gift card

IHG Best Rate Guarantee

IHG BRG: Introduction (Sept 2011)
 Started with very simple terms  `If you find a cheaper rate for the same hotel + date + room + rate
combination we will give you the first night free.'  Terms must be the same
 # of adults and children  Cancelation conditions  Inclusions (breakfast, ...)
 Use meta search engines to find better rates
 Community had known working sites for specific properties  Shared Google docs, ...

Intended BRG Process
 Book on IHG.com  Stumble on better rate  Fill out BRG form  Get BRG approved
 Low approval rate

Optimized BRG Process
 Check rate on IHG.com
 Use flexible rate
 Check competing sites  Find valid claim  Book on IHG.com  Fill out BRG form  Get BRG approved
 Cancel if not

How to stay multiple nights?

Issue: Only first night free

IHG BRG

 Use two guests  Day 1) guest A  Day 2) guest B  Day 3) guest A

IHG BRG: Multiple nights
 `Two guest attack' busted early on  Asked for names of all guests in room  Compared against other claims

IHG BRG: Multiple nights Redux

 Use multiple hotels  Day 1) hotel A  Day 2) hotel B  Day 3) hotel A

Hotel A (Indigo)

Hotel B (Holiday Inn)

 Busted via `50 miles apart' rule (2012)

IHG BRG: Countermeasures
 "Cannot claim hotels in your home town"  "Reimbursement after stay rather
than free stay" (2013)  "Have to book cheapest room"  "Only one claim per week" (2013)

IHG BRG: "flexible only" loophole
 IHG terms state
 "You need to compare against lowest rate"
 Usually non-refundable
 "If no non-refundable rate is available compare against cheapest third party rate"
 This effectively allows comparing against all IHG.com rates
 Look for almost booked out hotels
 Easy to automate when you have data  Book well in advance  Often works when town is busy (conference, event, ...)

IHG BRG: 2018 status
 No more free nights
 Will give up to 40,000 points credit instead  Points based on paid rate (5x normal points)
 Flexible rate trick still works
 Still gameable
 40,000 points are enough for a free night  Consider BRG points as bonus to regular stay  Use points at expensive hotel

Global Distribution Networks
... or how I accidentally found the holy grail

Global Distribution Networks (GDN)
 Comparable to GDS (Amadeus, Sabre, ...) for airlines
 Hotels (suppliers) supply inventory  GDN distributes data to channel partners  Enables room booking
 XML/SOAP interfaces

It began with a cheap room
 I was looking for a cheap room in New York  Presidential suite had same price as regular room
 Room feature: ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act)
 Wheelchair accessible, roll-in shower, audible/visible alarms, ...
 These rooms have their own category
 Limited inventory, other price, ...

Missing room photo!

Look for the pillow on hyatt.com as deal indicator.

`This looks a bit larger than usual'

Derbysoft support portal (2016)
 Found support portal by accident
 Unprotected on the internet  Search key was rate code on my Hilton New York folio
 Escalated issue to Derbysoft
 No answer. Never.  Fixed via Booking.com security team

Derbysoft support portal (2018)
 Revisited old support website  Saw a familiar green website flash on my screen  Redirected to login page
`My adblocker can also block login windows.'

Derbysoft status
 Escalated issue via suppliers.  Somewhat fixed. Somewhat.
 More sites found  Still sending clear text passwords  Still doing client side security
 Derbysoft never replied. replied once. Replied.
 Slow process  Promised fixes

Social Engineering
They know they messed up and want to talk

Social Engineering
 Book obvious mistake (e.g. $5 room) and wait for contact
 "Just give me the stay credit. I don't have to stay."  Allow them to save face and minimize damage
 Book more than you need
 Book two weeks on cheap rate  If they cancel offer to meet in the middle and keep one
 Negotiate on (and accept) downgrades
 Get soft benefits (breakfast, lounge access) instead of larger room
 Don't be too persistent.
 Accept points compensation

Mandatory travel
When you absolutely have to be at a specific place at a specific time

Saving money on mandatory travel
 Try best rate guarantees  Use corporate codes  Use points  Use meta search engines  Use cashback sites  Look for promotions

Summary
 Lots of deals available
 No 100% success guarantee
 Less exposure compared to air travel deals
 Great chance of deals being honored
 Be prepared to spend lots of time with analytics/Excel/CSVs  Hotel hunting is a fun sport
