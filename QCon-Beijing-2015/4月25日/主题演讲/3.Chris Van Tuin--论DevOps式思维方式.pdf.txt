THE NEED FOR SPEED
THE ACCELERATION OF APPLICATION DELIVERY FOR THE BUSINESS

BIMODAL IT
To capture digital opportunities, CIOs need to deal with speed, innovation, and uncertainty.  This requires operating two modes of enterprise IT:
conventional and "nonlinear."

WHAT CAN I.T. DO? I.T. CAN TURN OPS AND DEV INTO DEVOPS

"DevOps is a software development method that stresses communication, collaboration and integration between software developers and information technology (IT) professionals."[1]

PEOPLE
DEVOPS PROCESS TECHNOLOGY

Applying many of the principles of Agile software development to the full application lifecycle and incorporating automation and monitoring with just a touch of Lean Manufacturing theory.

WHAT ENABLES DEVOPS?
"Configuration in code"  Standardized environments  Linux containers  Automated provisioning
KEY CONCEPT: FAIL FAST AND RECOVER VS. NEVER FAIL

WHAT ENABLES DEVOPS?
CI/CD: Automated testing and deployment  Continuous integration  Continuous delivery
KEY CONCEPT: SMALL CHANGES = LESS RISK

WHAT ENABLES DEVOPS?
Continuous innovation  Developer self-service  Rapid prototyping
KEY CONCEPT: CULTURE CHANGE = ACCEPTANCE OF FAILURE

THREE KEY QUESTIONS FOR I.T. AND BUSINESS

1
How to quickly and reliably deliver new
capabilities?

2

3

What kinds of new apps and services to deliver
and support?

Where to create and run new apps and services?

DEVOPS IS PART OF A LARGER SHIFT

HOW?
DEVOPS + CONTAINERS

WHAT? CLOUD APPS

WHERE?
OPEN HYBRID CLOUDS

DEVOPS + CLOUD = INDUSTRIALIZE

DEVOPS FOR APPLICATIONS
?
What will you produce with your new cloud factory and DevOps manufacturing process?

DEVOPS WORKFLOW

OPS

 Create containerized IaaS or PaaS development environment

App dev environment

 Provision environment locally or at OpenShift by Red Hat
 Write app as containerized microservices DEV cluster and commit changes
 Push changes through CICD and automated testing system to containerized staging
DEV  Scheduler orchestrates and deploys app OPS  Monitor and operate app

"It could take 6 weeks to get a single word
changed on the web site."

"It took 2 years after a competitive start-up
launch to get a competing product to market."

"When developers work in Node.js, they can change the code they're working on, direct it
to run, and see whether it works-in the blink of an eye."

"The environment, while stable, didn't use the sexiest
technologies, which made recruiting difficult."
