Review the history

1994
- 20 years ago - Netscape navigator was released. - People can build web page using HTML+CSS.

2008
- 7 years ago - Apple iOS was released. - People can build iOS native app using C/OC.

2011
- 4 years ago - Adobe PhoneGap was released. - People can build iOS hybrid app using HTML+CSS.

2013
- 2 years ago - GeekZoo BeeFramework was released. - People can build iOS hybrid app using XML+CSS.

2015
- 1 month ago - Facebook react-native was released. - People can build iOS hybrid app using JS+CSS.

Today
We need to re-thinking about app architecture ...

Problem

?
Native

Hybrid

We try to build native apps, over times get more complicated and more people to the team, it breaks down.

Native
 Well  Good user experience  Low level API
 Less well  Hard to deploy  High learning cost

Native

?
Hybrid

We try to build web apps using thin native API wrappers, but it doesn't work. The problem is the user experience.

Hybrid
 Well  Cross platform  Easy to deploy
 Less well  Bad user experience  Low learning cost

User experience
Human/Time cost

Native + Hybrid ?

React Native

The reason why we built React-Native. We want to get the best part of native and web.

The mission is to build a good enough native framework + web-core.

We call it `Semi-Hybrid'

Well
 Good user experience  Good performance  Good expansibility  Rapid development (HTML+CSS)  Easy to deploy, and easy to share  Low level API

Less well
 High R&D costs (WebCore)  High maintenance costs (WebCore)  Stack is too deep  Need to learn basic front-end & basic iOS knowledge

Features of Semi-Hybrid
 Support HTML/CSS or other UIML syntax  Support native components  Support gesture handling  Remote update & live reload

The difference
 Do you want <Text> or UILabel ?  Do you want <List> or UITableView ?  Do your want RCTView(drawRect) or AttributedString ?  Do you want <TouchableHighlight> or onClick = `' ?  Do you want Fluid-layout or Flex-Box layout ?  Do you want native gesture recognizer ?  Do you want ResponderChain ?  Do you want Xcode or Sublime ?  Do you want iPhoneSimulator or Chrome?

More native? or more web? Your team decide.

Yet another Semi-Hybrid framework.

Demo

The advantages
 Simple, more native, using XCode/iPhoneSimulator.
  Browser architecture.
  Full decoupling UI, data and business logic.
  Good alternative to WebView.
  Good native implementation.
  Low learning cost to native developers.
  Low learning cost to front-end developers.
