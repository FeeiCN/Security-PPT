WHAT ARE LINUX CONTAINERS?

 Used to create containers for software applications / microservices
 Containers provide lightweight isolation of process, network, filesystem spaces
 Package Once Deploy Anywhere
 Docker builds on Linux containers, adds an API, image format, runtime, and a delivery and sharing model

Containers provide a discrete package mechanism for application components or microservices
ADD NAME (View > Master > Slide master)

Several containers can live on a virtual or bare metal system
ADD NAME (View > Master > Slide master)

These containers are easily created and controlled by Docker tools
ADD NAME (View > Master > Slide master)

Finding and running containers is easy
-bash-4.2# docker run -P fedora/apache Unable to find image 'fedora/apache:latest' locally Pulling repository registry.access.redhat.com/fedora/apache Pulling repository fedora/apache 2e11d8fd18b3: Download complete 511136ea3c5a: Download complete ff75b0852d47: Download complete 0dae8c30a0b2: Download complete 84f33df93401: Download complete 24b116bb2956: Download complete a7f290a6f21d: Download complete eb86e2be11d4: Download complete c06d2cba0d4a: Download complete f0b140ef8cdd: Download complete b05601b61180: Download complete Status: Downloaded newer image for fedora/apache:latest

Containers cannot look outside of their namespace but admins can easily peak in, giving operational flexibility

ORCHESTRATION

More serious workloads require orchestration like Kubernetes to offload management overhead

Kubernetes allow operations teams to describe an application via json
