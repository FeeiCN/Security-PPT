System Overview

Our Challenges
     Online serving storage: 



   500TB+   1TB+   400K msg/s Overall
 Profile Server  feature 200+   12TB  1.2M qps

Batch Approach
 Batch MySQL   Daily Mapreduce Workflow
  0 user profile


 CPU   MySQL    user profile 


Streaming Approach
 A Storm Topology  mini-batch processing
  10 min    profile  base     profile

Pros.
 2 -> 10  

Cons.
          spam 
  user profile  batch   streaming  replay 

Hybrid Approach
  Streaming  Batch

Fight with Write-Amp
 rocksdb: LSM-Tree, compaction, 10x~, SSD   Our Solution:
  L0~L1 compaction   Customized Level Style Compaction
 L0  compaction => L0  L0  full compaction => L1   10x~ => 2~3x  https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/210
