Organisations struggle to identify relevant threats and setting up security monitoring/detection.
Alignment of security requirements to business objectives.
Availability of usable data that can be converted into tangible use-cases.
Expertise in building advanced monitoring content.

Speed of implementation
Ease and speed of onboarding the application and its use-cases.

Visibility within Organization
Ability to show the added business value of security monitoring.

 Assign the actions to execute once triggered

Testing

 Test the logic against data
 Monitor the performance of use-cases

Deploy in Production

Setup the usecases in
