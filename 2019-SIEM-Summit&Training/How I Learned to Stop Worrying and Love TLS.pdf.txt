Outline
 SIEM Data Sources affected by encryption  How are we dealing with it today  How is it about to change?  What you can do about it.

Network Data and SIEMs
 Many SIEMs focus on host based events  Great tools for collection them:
 Syslog  Sysmon  File Beat...
 Lots of valuable data

Why Bother With Network Data
 Host based data often requires agents / special configuration of host
 What about IoT, BYOD and other misc endpoints?  Host based data may be manipulated by the attacker  Network events are often indicative of what we worry about
(e.g. data loss)  Tends to be easy to collect (?)

Typical Sources of Network Data
 Full packet capture
 Can be expensive  But quite valuable for IR
 Network Traffic Summaries
 Most of the value of full pcaps, but cheaper
 IDS Data  Netflow

What's the Problem with Network Data?

 One chance to collect it. Packet loss is common  Encryption!  NAT / DHCP. IP Address may not relate to physical system  Cost of collecting full PCAPs:

Network Speed 1 Gbit

Data / Day 1-10 TBytes

How to "crack" Encryption
 TLS Primer  Passive decryption appliances  Proxies  End Point Solutions  Don't ...

TLS Primer
 SSL/TLS combines the scalability of public/private keys with the efficiency of symmetric encryption standards
 Very flexible to adjust to different requirements  Can authenticate, encrypt and protect integrity  Wide support  But... easy to mess up

TLS Handshake
ClientHello
ClientKeyExchange ChangeCipherSpec

ServerHello Certificate
ChangeCipherSpec Finished

ServerHello Certificate

JA3: TLS Fingerprinting
 Created by Salesforce (2017)  Open Source. Python library, Zeek module  BroSysmon to automate hash mapping  Distinguishes two Fingerprint hashes
 Client (JA3): md5(TLS Version, Ciphers, Extensions, EllipticCurves, EllipticCurvePointFormats)
 Server (JA3S): md5(TLS Version, Cipher, Extension)

Client Hello
 Supported TLS Versions  Ciphers supported by client  Various encryption parameters supported  "Client Random"  Server Name Indication  Application Layer Protocol Negotiation

Server Hello
 Selected TLS Version  Selected Cipher  "Server Random"  Certificate

Passive Decryption Appliances
 Passive decryption no longer works with modern / well configured TLS
 Diffie Hellman Keyexchanges are now universally used and decrypting the key exchange will no longer reveal the "premaster secret"
 Only way to make them work is to collect premaster secrets from end points: Requires agent.

Proxies
 Proxies essentially launch a MiTM attack against TLS  Works well. But requires that end points trust the proxies
certificate authority: Special endpoint configuration required  Can add substantial (> 100ms) latency / break some modern
web applications  But proxies are a great source of logs for your SIEM

End Point Solutions
 Proxies on end point intercepting requests  Browser plugins  End point configuration options  And more...

But what if we just don't bother?
 We can still get some data for our SIEM:
 SNI host names  Client Hello / Server Hello Fingerprints  Certificates (including issuers)

What can we learn from SNI?
 Hostname user is about to connect to  Can be used to compare to block lists / IoC feeds  DOES NOT HAVE TO BE RIGHT (domain fronting)  Should also show up in DNS queries

SNI Related Queries
 "top new host names" (similar to DNS query)  "unusual host name" (length, entropy)  SNI is one of the more useful TLS Client Hello options  But...

TLS 1.3
 Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) now the default.  Sharing server keys will no longer work (hasn't worked well
without TLS)  Encrypted Certificate. No longer easy to verify that SNI matches
Certificate  Key_share extension re-uses keys negotiated in prior
connection. Can be negotiated out-of band (unlikely)  Server Random indicates TLS 1.3 support even if TLS 1.1/2 is
used.

Encrypted SNI (eSNI)
TXT _esni.example.com /wGKAw..AAA=
TLS 1.3 Client Hello

Normal Client SNI

Encrypted Client SNI

DNS?
 _esni.* TXT requests can be recorded / blocked  These requests would still be visible  But browsers may not use ESNI unless "TRR" (Trusted Recursive
Resolver) is configured  TRR = DNS over HTTPS

Recent Attack: "Reductor" (Kaspersky)
 Patches Chrome/Firefox  Adds "userid" field to client random  Attacker uses this to identify victims during TLS handshake  Malware also has ability to install certificates

How to detect "Reductor"
 Profile client random  Look for fixed static strings  Calculate entropy

DoH Botnets: Godlua
 Linux DDoS Botnet July 2019  First uses "regular" DNS query to lookup C2 domain:
d.heheda.tk  Uses Github/Pastebin for C2  Uses DoH queries to retrieve TXT records that contain
ciphertext

GodLua DoH Query (QiHoo 360)
GET /dns-query?name=t.cloudappconfig.com&type=TXT
Host: cloudflare-dns.com Accept: application/dns-json
{"Status": 0, "TC": false ... "Question": [{"name": "t.cloudappconfig.com", "type": 16}], "Answer": [{
"name":"t.cloudappconfig.com.", "type": 16, "TTL": 214, "data": "[ciphertext]"} ]}

How to detect GodLua?
 DoH uses "odd" mime-type  Requires TLS interception  Usually, DoH uses "application/dns-message"  Response in binary  GodLua uses "application/dns-json"  Response in JSON. More for debugging

PsiXBot
 Identified August/September 2019 (Proofpoint)  Earlier versions back to 2017  FastFlux DNS Infrastructure  RC4 encryption with hard coded static key  Source of some sextortion emails and malspam  Distributed via Spelevo EK

PsiXBot DNS Query
GET /resolve?name=fnoetwotb4nwob524o.hk&type=A
Host: dns.google.com Accept: application/dns-json
{"Status": 0, "TC": false ... "Question": [{"name": "fnoetwotb4nwob524o.hk", "type": 6}], "Authority": [{
"name":"fnoetwotb4nwob524o.hk.", "type": 6, "TTL": 599, "data": "a.dnspod.com. domainadmin...."} ]}

How to Deal with DoH?
 TLS interception will still work  Currently: bots use JSON format while normal DoH does not  Block DoH
 Deploy "use-application-dns.net" NXDOMAIN response.  Block DoH IPs/Hostnames  Enforce client configuration

Or... just let it happen
 TLS interception will still provide data  Parse responses and treat them like DNS logs  Lots of other indicators for the activity  Blocking it may just push it to a different channel (e.g. custom
DoH)
