MuleSoft Running in Hybrid Cloud

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 On-Premise Runtimes
 Traditional deployment mode,
provides maximum control when Cloud is not the first option

 Greater flexibility with support for multiple deployment scenarios

What about Log Management?

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Challenges introduced by running in Hybrid Cloud
 No central place to aggregate logs  On-premise: full control of logging, but
limitations on storage
 Cloud: logs are spread across each
application, some limitations on storage
 Multiple cloud locations to troubleshoot issues

What about Log Management?

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Challenges introduced by using API lead integration
 Small APIs compose an application, thus
many logs entries will encompass a single transaction
 Requires strategy for stitching the
transaction

Splunk Cloud to Solve these Challenges

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

A platform like Splunk Cloud allows you to:
1. Centrally aggregate logs 2. Ingest logs from diverse cloud
environments
3. Create a single view of transaction 4. Perform schema-less log ingestion 5. Scale in the Cloud as required

Improving Performance by Indexed Field Extractions
You can trigger indexed field extractions of JSON fields in two ways. As part of main "event" or separate from the "event"
Use nested JSON inside the "event" property
{"sourcetype":"_json", "event":"{\"uuid\":\"2ab7b65e-4d87-43d0-8cef-87b6b429086b\",\"action\":\"test-http-eventcollector\"}"}
Or add a "fields" property at the top JSON level
{"sourcetype":"_json","event":"hello world!","fields":{"uuid":"2ab7b65e-4d87-43d0-8cef-87b6b429086b","action ":"test - http event "}}
Use tstats command to leverage indexed fields and speed up your search
| tstats count where index=xyz api=123 by _time, a, b, c

Improving Performance SPL and Search Optimization
Retrieve only the required data | Move as little data as possible | Parallelize as much work as possible | Set appropriate time windows
search and filter | munge | report | cleanup
sourcetype=access*
| eval KB=bytes/1024
| stats sum(KB) dc(clientip)
| rename sum(KB) AS "Total KB" dc(clientip) AS "Unique Customers"
