Testing

Benchmarking Guidelines
Environment and Setup
 3 Node Kubernetes Cluster  Master - m4.large  Nodes - m4.16xlarge
 Splunk Deployment  Focus is on a single node indexer performance
 Tested with different message sizes  256 Byte  1 KiB
 30 containers generating 1000 messages/sec each  30K messages/sec/node

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Benchmarking Results
256 byte Message Size
 Consistent ~7.5 Mbps and ~30K EPS through indexer
 Results repeatable with different buffer size
 Executed 4X with 60 sec pause in between

Benchmarking Results
1KiB Message Size
 Consistent ~20 Mbps and ~20K EPS through indexer
 Results repeatable with different buffer size
 Executed 4X with 60 sec pause in between

Testing in the Wild
Results in a less controlled environment
 AWS Openshift Quickstart Cluster (Oregon)  3x Master - m4.xlarge  3x Nodes - m4.xlarge
 SplunspklunDk-keubpelroneytems-loeggnintg-7jhrc  Standalone Splunk with 2 indexing pipes  12 Cores 96GB ram, bare metal with 20% CPU utilization  Consumer ISP internet (60Mbps down/ 10Mbps up)
 Message sizes  256 bytes, 1000 bytes, 256KB
 30 containers generating 1000 messages/sec each  ~9 Million messages generated in 5 mins

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Testing in the Wild
Results in a less controlled environment
 Indexing throughput  Maxed ~3MB/s - Not bad for public internet!
 Indexing Latency  Saw up to ~7 mins indexing delay, but no message loss

Benchmarking Guidelines
Load Balancing
 HEC Architecture  Single Connection (HF)
 Each logging pod has 1 connection to
HEC
 HF or LB can be used to spread logs
across indexer tier
