 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Technical Challenges
What issues did we run into on the technical side

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Data comes in a dizzying array of unpredictable formats and structures and in a large variety, velocity and volume.
 Mix of structured (csv, tsv, psv, other) and unstructured data  Some complexities in terms of field or time extraction  Creative regex-ing needed to clean garbage characters without pre-processing  Not all data was available at the same time

Existing Solutions
What are the issues with existing non Splunk Solutions

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Expensive
 In some deployments only fraction of functionality is used
 Data must match internal data models and fit predefined standarts
 Require customization with every deployment (every customer has custom EMR data to meet each doctor's requirements)
 Require ongoing maintenance/management by a team of 4-7 people to get to a usable state

Splunk Advantage
Why use Splunk
 Extremely easy to onboard any data and customize Splunk to that data  Extremely easy to maintain  Can complement existing solutions  Fast time to value  Real time alerting capabilities  Can help monitor compliance with Meaningful Use

Development Standards & Conventions
Guiding principles and conventions to direct solution development

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Early definition of standards vital
 Established consistency in naming conventions across indexes and source types
 Defined index layout to enable access control needs by hospital campus/location
 Guidelines and methodology for field extractions and other index/searchtime configuration
 Approach to lookups, lookup generation, summary population, macros, etc.

Indexed lookup data for greater flexibility

Legacy System
Pre-Splunk solution for privacy monitoring

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Application developed in-house
 Provided baseline requirements
 Legacy App SME a tremendous asset to understand data, reporting, and team operations

Primary Use Cases
Dashboards, reports, and alerts to provide needed visibility

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Accesses by User Over Time  Accesses by Users to a Given MRN  Higher than User Normal  Excessive Hours with Activity  Access Outside of Work Hours  Excessive Demographics Access

 Employee Access to Employee Patient Records
 Failed Login Attempts  Compare Usage Among Peers  Access by Inactive User  Access to VIP

Solution Building Blocks
Key information across data sources for use case development

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Patient Identification
Medical Record Numbers (MRNs) of patients accessed by employees

User Information
Employee usernames, locations, job functions, and status

User Actions
User actions performed on patient records across disparate systems

Patient IDs
Patient MRNs from audit logs and lookups

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Audit log data may contain:  Enterprise Unique Identifier  Local Identifier(s)  Application-specific Patient Identifier  No Patient Identifier
 Lookups used to:  Map Enterprise Unique ID to Local IDs  Map app IDs to Local IDs

EUID

EUID

LID

Patient IDs: The "Big Lookup"
Mapping of local IDs to enterprise ID

 Export from internal system with 40 million rows plus daily incremental updates
 Initially implemented with KV Store but
encountered serious performance issues and failures
 Implemented as a standard lookup with solid
performance
 Summary index patient_id populated with EUID if exists and uses LID if no EUID
 Dashboards, reports, and alerts leverage patient_id

1.1 GB lookup file size

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

User Information
Employee data from enterprise LDAP
 Identity data essential across all use cases:  Username  Real name  Hospital affiliation, department, title  Account status
 Automatic lookups used to normalize application-specific usernames/IDs for specific source types
 Also used to create Personnel dashboard

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

User Actions
Normalizing user activity to higher-level action categories

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Thousands of individual appspecific actions in audit logs mapped to higher-level categories (e.g., create, view, update, etc.)
 Normalization originally via lookup but moved to event types
 A manual process made much easier with Splunk search

90,000+ unique actions in 24h of data

Dashboard/UI Strategy
Approach to instrumentation

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Consistent UI controls for filtering by application, action, and user/MRN.
 Data presented from various dimensions  By user: Patient records viewed by a user over
time by application and action.
 By patient: User activity on a specific patient
record over time by application and action.

 Dashboards driven by summary index and accelerated data model
 Extensive use of drilldowns including to print-friendly reports
 Utility dashboards to "auto-document" data source status

Key Takeaways
Lessons learned or reinforced

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Define conventions up front to save time and re-work
 I <3 Lookups  | lookup vs. automatic lookups  Indexed lookup data + output lookup = J
 KV Store is great but it has its limitations
 Indexed extractions directly to normalized field names
 Splunk is just as awesome with clinical data as it is with IT stuff

Luke Murphey's Lookup File Editor is essential.

Conclusion
 Splunk provides the scale needed for healthcare privacy and auditing using both on-premises/cloud/hybrid deployment

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Minor dependency on data formats and data delivery mechanisms

 You have complete control over all aspects of the platform - from data ingestion to alerting, investigations and case closed.

 Use to solve large number of healthcare privacy and auditing use cases.

 Predictable effort to manage, customize and enhance platform.
