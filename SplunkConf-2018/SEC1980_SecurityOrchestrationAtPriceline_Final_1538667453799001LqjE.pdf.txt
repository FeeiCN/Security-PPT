3 Observations

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

"Security and other Ops team spent most
of the time working on tasks that are
repetitive in security operations while all
has limited staff"

"There's a gap of knowledge between security team and Ops team when executing actions for an incident"

"The results are hard to document into a single place for future references"
