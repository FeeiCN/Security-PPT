What is Machine Data?
MANUFACTURING
Operational technology (OT) and Sensor data Industrial controls, SCADA, actuator and other equipment IDC estimates that by 2025, more than a quarter of data created in the global datasphere will be real time in nature, and real-time IoT data will constitute more than 95% of this.
Work order data Alarms, location and inventory data Maintenance work order processes need to be defined and managed as an integrated part of the production order, materials procurement and logistics processes.
Security data Firewall data, endpoint data A 2018 security study revealed 147 vulnerabilities in 34 separate SCADA mobile applications.
