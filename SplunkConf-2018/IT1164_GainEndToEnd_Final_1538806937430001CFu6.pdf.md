How Azure Makes Data Available

Different Planes for Data
Control & Data

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Control Plane: System Configuration and Management Data Plane: Provisioned Service and Diagnostic Data

Storage Account
Storage Accounts are the Least Common Denominator for Azure Services

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Azure writes data to storage. Raw JSON, log lines, CSV, etc.

Blob or Table

Storage Account Blobs
Similar to a File system

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Account
My Storage Account

Container
pictures
movies

Blob
IMG01.PNG folder/IMG02
.PNG
MOV1.MPG

Example: NSG Flow Logs

Storage Account Table
Similar to CSV or Database Table

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Account
My Storage Account

Table
customers
photos
Example: VM Performance Logs

Entity
Name = ... Email = ...
Name = ... Email = ...
PhotoID = ... Date = ...

REST APIs
Metadata, Topology, Consumption

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

{ REST }

Event Hubs
High Velocity and Scale

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Azure Monitor (moves data to Event Hubs)
The Azure Monitor Add-on for Splunk pulls data from Event Hubs

Azure Functions
Serverless Code

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Serverless code can take action on events in the hub.
Azure Function blueprints to push data to Splunk via HEC: https://github.com/Microsoft/AzureFunctionforSplunkVS

Where do Add-ons run?
Indexing, forwarding, egress, compression

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Forwarder Inside Azure?

Possible Data Egress (tiered costs)

Inside Azure
VM Cost - OpEx
S2S compression = lower egress usage
Filtering via Splunk options prior to egress

Outside Azure
CapEx
Uncompressed data = more egress usage
Filtering on API level requires coding

Indexing
Forwarder Outside Azure?
