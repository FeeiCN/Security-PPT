The Foundation of Digital Ops is Capturing Enterprise Data in an Integrated Platform

MY CUSTOMER AND MY BUSINESS

 What are today's sales?  Who is buying?  What channels are being used?  Are marketing processes running as planned?  What is being purchased?  What purchase methods are being used?  Are customer contact details changing?

 What is the impact of the latest software release?
 What should the development team prioritize for the next release?
 What is the quality of the software delivery?
 Can I measure the uptake of new capability by customers?

ONE PIECE OF DATA CONTAINS ANSWERS TO MULTIPLE QUESTIONS

DIGITAL OPS
ANALYTICS | INSIGHT | AUTOMATION

IT OPERATIONS AND SECURITY

 Is my application available?
 Are transactions erroring and triggering automated remediation?
 Is performance as expected?
 How do I need to manage my capacity or cloud scaling?
 Are my production lines running? How does that connect with customer demand?

 Where are transactions flowing from and to? Are they within normal bounds? Should the transaction be stopped automatically?
 Are there fraud indicators in the payment type or delivery address?
 Have I validated the integrity of the payment gateway responses outside of my software code?
 What is the risk score from the payment processor?
