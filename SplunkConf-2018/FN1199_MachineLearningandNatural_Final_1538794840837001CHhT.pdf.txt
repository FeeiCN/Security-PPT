What is BMW Group IT Innovation Lab?

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Focusing on innovative use cases inside BMW Group
 Know-How in computer algorithms, data science and AI
 Close networking with the innovation departments at specialists area (Manufacturing, Logistics ...)
 Early adoption of new technologies, transfer to industry

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
The Goal of the Predictive Model
Human-Centered Machine Learning

The goal of the Predictive Model

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Overarching concept for all road users
 Predict trends of traffic patterns with the highest accuracy
possible
 Focus on challenges around urban mobility  Create action plans on making traffic in the future more
efficient
 For the individual user
 Prediction of ideal navigation and travel time  Allow to change route or timing to arrive at destination more
efficiently

Procedure and Achievements

Data Collection

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Data from in-development test fleet provides insights on
commuting and mobility habits

Movements tracked over four weeks with data transmitted
in real-time to Splunk

Historical data about the month was used as the basis to train the model

Organising Data
 City of Munich is divided into cells  Traffic data defined features, in each cell,
gathered from the participants
 User departure time in hourly intervals  User arrival time in hourly intervals  GPS of departure and destination points  Road types  Waiting times  Weather  Accidents

Build and Train a model

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Algorithm:
 Non-linear Algorithm
 Random Forest Regressor  Through supervised learning, discrepancies were
adjusted in order to enhance the accuracy of predictions  A local search finds the most similar traffic state in the traffic history  Blends real-time traffic data with past traffic patterns to predict congestion and other traffic events

What we wanted to achieve with Project NLS

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
1. Allow non-technical people to ask
questions of data in Splunk
2. Use the Traffic Prediction Machine
Learning models and generated results
3. Ask the question
"what is the predicted traffic at point X on date Y at time Z?"

Project Achievements

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Predicting hourly, daily, seasonal trends in Munich traffic

Live monitoring on the map of car pick-up events

Live monitoring of public transport coverage gaps

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Future Objectives
Expanding the Model

Future Objectives

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Appropriate reaction after accidents, which cannot be predicted.
 Once an accident has occurred, the gridlock follows predictable
patterns  Include more data from individual users:
 Using GPS data from single users' smartphones, the software learns
your preferred travel times and routes
 Include user satisfaction: query satisfaction data through an app  Predict anomalies like vacation days
 It leads to more insights and to making more accurate and user-centric predictions
