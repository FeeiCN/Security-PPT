Time Recording & Security
The basic setup

How Did the Timesheet Catch the Spy?
Joke or the downfall of the insider threat
 Nearly all enterprises from big to small require employees to account for their time for a magnitude of reasons
 The objective is to utilise current hardware deployments (CYOD/BYOD) to capture this information, push it to Splunk and transform it into intelligence
 Meaning no more filling in time sheets manually!

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

The Big Idea
Using hardware the user already has

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Capture data from deployed hardware

Push the data to Splunk

Splunk Enterprise indexes data and
generates intelligence

Intelligence used to capture the inside threat. Operations
can continue

Why This...
Unlike other projects, its "not just because I can"
 Personnel Security
 Real-time geo-fencing data is ideal to aid in
protection of personnel and the threat towards them
 E-privacy
 Time Management
 Overtime, annual leave, sickness etc. these
can all be calculated without the user interacting with time sheets
 Anomalies in behaviour can be examined
deeper
 Money Saving
 See what rooms are being used and where the
power can be saved

Hardware and Software
The basic setup

Hardware
Smartwatches Smartphones
Tablets

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Software / Application
The smart part

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Not strictly Software, IFTTT is an app  If This Then That
 Create custom chains of conditional statements
 Automate tasks
- Such as Geo fence locations
 First thing to do is choose If This

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
 Many apps to choose from
 Can use device functions  Location, SMS etc

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
 Choose location

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
 3 options  Enter  Exit  Enter or Exit

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
 Select area to use as geo fence

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
 Can zoom to good scale for finer area

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
 Now this is done its time to choose that  The action for IFTTT to
take

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
 Choose Google Sheet  Details of Google drive
need to be entered

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
 2 options  Add row  Update cell

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
 Customise the Google sheet  Name of document  Details to be entered
by IFTTT
 Location of document

The Output
CSV with the chosen data

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
 Using the settings previously, this is what you would get  2 columns
 Date and Time  Event

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Now the Splunk magic
Indexing, Formating and Analysing

The Splunk Part

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

All sorts of intelligence can be generated with the simple CSV generated

 The data from the CSV can be manipulated to give you so much detailed data, such as:
 Entry time  Exit time  Overtime calculations  Average working hours  Unusual work times  Visually stunning graphics for the hierarchy
The main point is....Unusual working hours!
I will show you how this simple CSV can highlight unusual behaviour and can be alerted on for further analysis

The Basics
Google sheet is indexed as CSV

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Data added as CSV using standard `add data'
 Simple 2 columns

Step 1

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
 First thing to do is transaction the events  Enter work  Exit work  = one transaction

Step 2

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
 Work out total hours per transaction  Create new field of
day_total
 Uses duration divided
by seconds in a day

Step 3

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
 Ensure good transactions are shown  closed_txn=1
 1 day = sum of day_total and renamed to Total

Step 4

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
 Calculate the last 30 days total
 Work out average amount of hours  Average can be used
to get overall view of time present in a set period

Step 5

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
 Tidy up by rounding the numbers
 Work out if they have been in or not (weekends)

Step 6

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
 Calculate average of of worked time  Not including
weekends and leave etc

Step 7

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
 Add condition to only class a work day as more than two hours  Personal setting for my
time but can be changed to anything
 Then round the average to a useable number

Step 8

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
 Beautify the results with some renames

Results

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
 Now we have useable data for working stats

Why Stop There!

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Using the same data and a mix of other Splunk commands  If functions  Time formatting  Avg  list
 A more detailed view can be achieved

More Detail...

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 A more detailed table can be created

Visually Better

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Leading to a more visually pleasing chart of the users working hours

Easier To Understand

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Not only is it visually better
 It can also be used to highlight data you may want to set alerts for
 For example, we have an above average time with a visible peak in out of hours presence

The So What...

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 This peak shows that the user was present in work out side of the times set for the users normal working day  What was the user doing  Should they be in at that time  Why are they in 2 hours longer than normal  Insider threat???
 How about:  Exfil  Log deletion  Implant
All is not lost! You can alert to this potential threat potentially before it happens

Alerts

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
 Looking at behaviour of their normal working hours
 Alerts can be generated for anything out of the norm

What About Way Points

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Using the IFTTT and the recording setup, its also possible to set way points of a route taken.
 Think about:
 Personnel at risk of kidnap  Security vans  Routine movement of company property

Future Plans

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Going forward with the project

 In its current version, time recording is done with IFTTT, the plan to go forward is:  Create separate application for iOS and Android and place in App Stores  Feed data directly in to Splunk, not via CSV monitor  Link alerting to mail server  Manager app
 See live data for manager perspective
 Health and safety - Fire evacuation, who is where
 Create a TA for Splunk to partner with the App from the app store, the benefits of this would be:  Pre built dashboards displaying key information  Simple alerting so key security concerns can be received as soon as possible

Cross industry utility

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Where else can this be used...

 The time recording app and TA would not only benefit security teams, but what about...  Automotive - Where are the vehicles = Where should new charging points be  Hours in hospital for surgeons - tired surgeon, error in surgery  Professional drivers - Leave the depot, are they resting?  Education - Are students attending lectures?  Staff of interest - Is kidnap a risk at your organisation  Basically anything with a GPS signal.....

The possibilities are endless for location based monitoring in Splunk, if it isn't normal behaviour, what is it??
