How did we get here?
And why am I in this hand basket?

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Our Start
This is where the subtitle goes  Splunk Cloud and Enterprise Security purchased by the Mars security team
· Originally only used by SOC analysts  Security team wanted to get additional value from the existing data and let other IT Ops teams
start to use it · New teams had no training and Security team didn't have time to train them · Also wanted new data sources added quickly · Ops even started a major project to improve Visibility across the enterprise!  Additional data meant more hardware to handle the data flow  And all the new users asking for data, or support, or training
 All this being done by 1 person!
Can you see where this is headed?

How can we get better?

Address Staffing Shortage
What if Greg were hit by a bus?

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Short Term: Staff augmentation from Splunk Professional Services
· Highly trained people right away to take
over some of the load.
· PS consultant roll over leads to recurring
ramp up time that is wasted.
· Not scalable.
· Not Sustainable.

 Long Term: Contract staffing through a Splunk trained partner
· Highly scalable.
· Sustainable.
· Slow to implement as contracts have to
go through a lengthy process.
· Shared service provided by the partner
enables a networking effect that improves service quality.

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Phase 1: Clean Up
Paying down Critical Technical Debt : 3 to 6 months of work
 Splunk Professional Services was brought in to help clean up · Remove unused apps. · Properly configure some data sources. · Some data sources had changed formats since their initial onboarding and needed to be
updated.
· Rebuilt a search head since it had been managed so poorly before and was performing
poorly.
 Also took some of the support load · Freed up Greg's time to re-architect areas he didn't have time to earlier. · Worked with automation team to implement Add-ons. · Helped build a new process to use Docker to run test environments as well as collect data.

Phase 2: Staff On-Boarding
On-going and iterative process
 On-boarding new staff is difficult  Even more difficult when you don't have any documentation
· R-syslog · Docker · HA-Proxy · GitLab
 Initial task for team contractors was to document EVERYTHING! · On-prem infrastructure · Data types
But how do you run this new team?

Mars Differences

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Focused on certain areas rather than the whole CoE Program · Focused on Platform and Program Management Service Areas
 Used a Steering Group instead of having a single CoE lead or Program Manager · Subtle difference but has a large impact on flow of new work · Priority is established by subject matter experts

Lessons Learned
 What could we have done better? · We could have addressed the problem before it became critical · Gotten leadership buy in for additional resourcing sooner · Anticipated better the workload that additional demand would bring · The amount of time it would take to educate and inform users
