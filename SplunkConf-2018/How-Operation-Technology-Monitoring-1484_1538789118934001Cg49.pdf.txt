"The smarter you are, the less you speak."
Arabic Proverb

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Implementing Splunk with MLTK in mind - Best Practice
 Worry about your model  Assemble the right data  Try automate identifying logs  Separate each log source by
vendor type and product name  Tagging the data by unique
customers  Ingest data from L1/L2/L3 to L4  Test before launching enterprise-
wide solution

Why MLTK?
How does MLTK help OT?
 IT Systems within OT:  Easy but ... so many legacy  "Too much data"  Eat everything, ... filter later ...
 ICS Applications Logs  Complex  Is it possible?
 Large Datasets = Rare updates = MLKT
