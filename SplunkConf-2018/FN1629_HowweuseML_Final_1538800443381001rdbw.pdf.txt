What is Data Driven Drill Path?

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Recommend drill path navigation in a selected visualization based on learned preference
Sales by Country

Learns user's preferred navigation path in a chart type

Natural Language Search NLP

Capture preference change over time!

Deep Dive: Trending Search Recommendation

Collaborative Filtering
make automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preference information from many users (collaborating)

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

daily sales in seattle last month?

daily sales last week in london? how much espresso sold in vancouver? daily sales in san francisco last month?

daily sales in vancouver last week?

how much espresso sold in seattle? -?-
how much spicy chai sold in vancouver?
daily sales in san francisco last week?

in this case we observe the questions users ask about stores in specific city locations

Collaborative Filtering

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Purple asked questions about Seattle and not London
Pink asked questions about San Francisco and Seattle
Green asked questions about San Francisco, Seattle and not London





Purple and Pink have asked

the same questions as Green







 for matching location.







 Based on the match, Green is

not likely to ask questions

about Vancouver

Where next?

1. More user interface driven ML!
2. Sequence to sequence prediction - predict Next Query for Dialog based interaction
3. Federated learning - sharing trained models (not data) to help everyone

Key Takeaway

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Machine learning can be used to solve a myriad of problems.
We have shown you production examples of machine learning used to improve the usability of an application.
You can use the same techniques in your daily work to accomplish similar
results.
