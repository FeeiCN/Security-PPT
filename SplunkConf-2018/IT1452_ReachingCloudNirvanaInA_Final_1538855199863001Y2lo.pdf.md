Visibility
"All Apologies," developers asking the IT for help
First step is getting visibility into your various clouds both public and private, centralize logging and start building an inventory of what you have.

Start by normalizing your cloud deployments into one data platform

Hybrid Cloud with Splunk
Hybrid between on premises and cloud

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Splunk as an example  While migrating off on premises hardware, setup hybrid to search older data. Once it ages off,
shutdown legacy indexers.
 Cutover forwarders to Cloud and collect only in Cloud  Migrate primary workload to Cloud, keep dev / test on premises or in a less expensive cloud

Hybrid Cloud with Splunk
Hybrid spread across clouds not recommended

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Splunk as an example
 Separating indexers from search heads to `save cost' will end up hurting performance and
cost more in the long term
 Transit costs can add up when dealing with Bundle Replication etc.
 Latency over different networks and varying machine types can spell trouble search
performance

Hybrid Cloud with Splunk
A case for Hybrid: HA/DR / Dev stack
 Splunk as an example  Centralize Splunk into one cloud and forward data into that single cloud.  This saves on transit costs and increases search performance.  Create DR/HA with multiple regions / clouds to safeguard against
disasters using replication or sync of configurations
 Create a Dev Stack to test changes to your Splunk Apps before going to
production. Use less expensive `spot' instances stack.
