Zipkin & Splunk: Tracing Transactions Across Your Ecosystem

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Session ID: 1256
 Title: Zipkin & Splunk: Tracing Transactions across your ecosystem
 Abstract:
Containers, microservices and serverless computing are here to stay, but how do you track performance across these complex, short-lived ecosystems? Zipkin is an open source, open tracing library that enables you to trace transactions from system to system in a standard way. Those traces can be collected and visualized in Splunk! Come see how to use Zipkin and Splunk together to see how transactions navigate your systems and services.

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Let's Start at the Beginning
Containers, Microservices and Serverless...Oh my!

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Monolith apps  Distributed apps  Microservices  Serverless  Transactions  External Systems?
 How do I monitor this?

Docker Containers, Kubernetes Pods

But Wait, There's More Complexity
 Dockerless Containers (OCI), Kubernetes or Mesos?  AWS, GCP, Azure or all together?  IaaS, PaaS  DevOps, CI/CD (what version?)

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 How Do I monitor this? Logs, Metrics & Tracing
"Observability"

Monitoring or Observability?
Both!

Monitoring
 Logs & Metrics  Passive (poll)
 `I observe you'  Measure machines, networks, apps  Overall Health  Use Cases
 Monitoring  Alerting  Troubleshooting  Capacity Planning

Observability
 Logs, Metrics & Traces  Active (push/code)
 `Make yourself observable'  Measure interactions  Granular Insights  Use Cases ++:
 Debugging  Distributed Tracing  Performance Analysis  Behavioral Analytics

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Distributed Tracing
 A long history...  Tag-and-Follow  Application Tracing  Transaction Tracing  Cross Process Tracing
 Conceptually easy, but difficult to implement
 GUID? SessionID? UserID?  Wait...I can't change that system  Multiple Vendors  No consistency

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Enter Open Tracing
 In the beginning...  There was Dapper (2010)
 Great if you're Google L  Consistent hardware  Application templates  Zero involvement to instrument
 Enter OpenTracing  Consistent, vendor-neutral APIs  Multiple implementations  Plug-n-Play
 Zipkin, Jaeger, Lightstep

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

ZipZWiphkaint?
An OpenTracing Implementaion

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Zipkin OpenTracing with Splunk!
Topology

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Performance Metrics Traces

OK, But How?
 HTTP Event Collector  Zipkin `Recorder'  Application Code
// Create an instance of the Splunk recorder const {recorder} = require('./recorder'); // initialize tracer const tracer = new Tracer({ctxImpl, recorder}); // instrument the client const zipkinRest = rest.wrap(restInterceptor,{tracer, serviceName: 'frontend'});
