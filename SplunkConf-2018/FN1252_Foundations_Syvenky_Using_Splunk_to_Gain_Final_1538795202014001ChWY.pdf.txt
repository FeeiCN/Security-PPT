What is going to be covered?

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Safety Data from Transport Canada and the NTSB
 Insights from plain text.  Heatmap by Date.  Clustered occurrences by Region.  Review the Canadian and American
dashboards.  Minimal conf needed to process
XML.  Use of OneDrive for data file
storage.

Data captured over-the-air via Raspberry Pi based receiver.
 Accessing data from IoT hardware.  Do commercial aircraft speed?
 By altitude and proximity to airport.  Using GPSBabel and Google Maps
for 3D visualization.  Stratux app demo of Orlando
Airport.

Why do this?
 Curiosity. Curiosity about flight safety. Curiosity about the challenge.
 Being able to combine two interests (Aviation, Data Visualizations).
 An interest in expanding my ability to gain insights from data.
 Splunk makes it easy.

Incident and accident data from Transport
Canada and the NTSB

About these Open Data Sources

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Transport Canada (TC): Freely available data that I have been processing in my local Splunk environment since January `17.

 National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB): I have only recently uncovered this data set.

 Data Ingestion, being a good data steward:  receive daily summary email from TC.  automating the migration of XML data to Splunk index.

 Calendar Heat Map Visualization for days with highest incidents

Wordcloud app for narrative field

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 The approach phase of flight is the most frequent cause of presence in reports (3.5 times more than the next highest cause, which is take-off).

 The narrative is in textual paragraph form from the TC investigators.

 The question:
What words show up most frequently in these reports?

 The word-cloud represents, in relative size, the frequency of words used as they pertain to the approach phase of flight.

" A Cessna 172K (C-GTXA) on a flight from Nanaimo, BC
(CYCD) and landing at Nanaimo, BC (CYCD) was on final for Runway 34. A Jazz de Havilland DHC-8-301 (CGETA/JZA8271) on a flight from Vancouver Int'l, BC (CYVR) to Nanaimo, BC (CYCD) was number 2 on final and did a go around due to the slower aircraft ahead."

Calendar Heat Map visualization showing days with highest incidents
 Transport Canada recorded a total of 17,392 CADORS reports in 2017, that's a national average of 47.6 incident/accidents per day. Thus far in 2018, we are at 10,906.
 The question:
Which days had the highest amount of reports?
 We can easily get access to the days that stand out for volume levels.

Cluster Map showing occurrences by region
 One of the categorical groupings that Transport Canada has is a data field called "TCRegion".
 The question:
After the heavy hitters were excluded from the data set, which would be the next highest?
 The frequency of occurrences for some airports is easy to guess, due to the size and the frequency of flights arriving and departing.

Data captured over-theair via Raspberry Pi based receiver

About Over-the-Air Data Sources
 The Stratux device is an Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) receiver made from a Raspberry Pi.
 The Project  What? A weather, traffic, GPS receiver.  How? Radio antennae capturing over the
air signals and logging to text file.
 Where? http://stratux.me

Speed Analysis

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 The data set is 5 months worth of logs in the vicinity of Calgary International (CYYC). The data set has > 22 million events.
 I have accurate data recorded from aircraft in the vicinity which ranges from altitude and heading to aircraft identifier and speed.
 The question:
Do commercial aircraft speed?
 For the first law, the bar chart shows the various carriers that are equipped with ADS-B. For the second law, we'll use a view by Google Earth.
 Future enhancements could easily include mashups with CADORS data or mashup with for-pay service data such as FlightAware.

Using GPSBabel to isolate events based on latitude and longitude

What is GPSBabel?

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 "GPSBabel converts waypoints, tracks, and routes between popular GPS receivers such as Garmin or Magellan and mapping programs like Google Earth or Basecamp."
 "It also has powerful manipulation tools for such data."
 "It has been downloaded and used tens of millions of times since it was first created in 2001, so it's stable and trusted."
