Other Examples of First Time Events in Real Life
Some are normal, some can be risky
 Cloud Storage File-sharing  Employee is planning to leave the company and downloads some unprotected sensitive files  A newly made presentation is shared for review among some group of employees
 Private Code Repositories  An account is compromised and cloned projects with intellectual property  Cloned project made by a colleague that I'm planning to collaborate on
 Badge Accesses  A worker enters the office servers room during off work hours  Same worker enters some other campus' meeting room during a business trip

Results
Applying this technique on data

Device Logins
 Login events into devices  Users have different roles that define their login behaviors  Heterogeneous set of device types  Other properties such as employee department, device subdomain are available  Distribution of device types, and user roles are biased
 Suspicious accesses happen with low probability  Accesses out-of-profile behavior

Q&A
Ignacio Bermudez Corrales| icorrales@splunk.com

First Time Events in Real Life
Some are normal, some can be risky
 Machine Accesses  IT workers frequently update machines. One updates a QA testing VM, is this risky?

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Cloud Storage File-sharing  Files are download or previewed once, some may be read by the "wrong" people

 Private Code Repositories  An employee's account got compromised and cloned projects with sensitive intellectual property

 Badge Accesses  Some worker entered the servers room of his office out of working hours

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
We Want Early Detection
The risk of first time event and why you should care
 Event linked to suspicious activity can happen only once  Attacker spear downloads single confidential file to local hard drive  Suspicious activity happens once and there are not after events to make a decision  Volume of data download, number of devices accessed, number of repos cloned, etc.
 Detecting suspicious activity based on post-events can be risky  Collecting post-events can take time, can we make an early decision?
 Many normal operations happen for a first time  Employee access some colleague's dev machine, architect downloads confidential document
regarding product design

First Time Events in Real Life
Some are normal, some can be risky
 Users access similar set of machines on a daily basis  IT workers frequently update machines. One updates a QA testing VM, is this risky?

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Employees share files in some cloud storage system  Files are download or previewed once, some may be read by the "wrong" people

 A git repository where all developers have read access  An employee's account got compromised and cloned projects with sensitive intellectual property

 Company keeps record of badge accesses  Some worker entered the servers room of his office out of working hours

Suspicious Accesses?

Examples of First Time Events
 First time ...  A user access a machine  A user enters a room in a building  A user opens a file in a private cloud  A user pulls code from a git repository  A user logins from a particular location  An employee mails another employee  And many other examples
 First time events can be pretty common

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
First Time Event Handling
How to deal with first time events?
 Conservative Approach  All first time events are suspicious and worth looking at one by one  In scenarios where the number of first time events is huge this requires excessive resources
 Laissez-faire Approach  We do not care about first time events  Easy to implement, but won't catch any concerning first time event
 Use Rules  They can cover low hanging fruits, but can't cover corner cases
 Use Machine Learning  Learns from historical patterns in the data, but can't learn from what haven't happened
 The answer resides between the last two!

Some Machine Learning Background
Things we should keep in mind through the presentation

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Machine learning algorithms approximate numerical data with a function
 History of events have to be represented as numbers to learn
 Linear regression: Given data points (x, y) find a and b such that y' = a x + b can reconstruct
the evidence

We need to model our problem numerically and we will find parameters that can reconstruct the evidence

Taming ML with Rules - Review
Passing down knowledge to machine learning algorithm

 Rules:  Embed human knowledge  Map event properties into numerical signal  Consume external properties of event entities  May have low coverage  Complements what can be seen in the history  Don't generalize
 Passing them down  Generate random events  If random event hit a rule add them to history  Control the number of random events to avoid
overfitting

Conclusion ( make 2 slides)
How this is implemented on Splunk. Where you can find it in splunk. A second slide is how this is gonna help you, compare to other products if possible (competitors).
 This can be implemented using Alternating Least Squares (ALS) on Spark  Can also be implemented in Python with some specific packages
 UBA suspicious first Box accesses use this approach  Captures when a user access a resource for the first time  Uses Active Directory extracted peer-groups  Rules based on file properties
 Not just prediction of suspicious first time event  Latent factors as "DNA" for entity behavior or characteristic  Latent factors ... explain .. Like a DNA  Enables further behavioral clustering of entities
 What this all means for a business (the impact, why this is important)  Save analyst time  It learns iteratively, custom to user needs.

Conclusion
Better than rules or machine learning alone
 Allows early detection of suspicious activity  Reduces the volume of first time events the analyst has to look at
