Research Phase

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Define what a service is and its various states
 Define requirement for monitoring
 Utilization
 Server Monitoring
 Can we correlate this?
 Other monitoring
tools?

Developing Splunk Apps

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Create mockups before
 We created a handful of "apps" separated by role and function
 We wanted a high level subsystem view and detailed service view

The Results

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 This is the start page of each Splunk App
 Contain the most necessary information
 While also enables you to drill down into the details and alerts
 Bridges together the IT/OT environments

The Results

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Contain info and stats around node and site failure with the EMS
 State of system helps to dictate urgency
 Use lots of lookups and KV Collections to monitor the state

The Results

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Subservice dashboard contains description
 Higher level information is a "defined" subsystem

The Results

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Centralized overview of alerts generated from Splunk

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Application and Process-Focused Dashboard
 Centralized overview of Processes

Sample Report
