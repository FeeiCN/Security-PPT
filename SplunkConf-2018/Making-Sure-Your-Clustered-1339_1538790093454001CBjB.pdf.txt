Quick Overview

Types of Management Components

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 The license master handles Splunk Enterprise licensing.
 The monitoring console performs centralized monitoring of the entire deployment.
 The deployment server updates configurations and distributes apps to processing components, primarily forwarders.
 The indexer cluster master node, sometimes referred to as the "cluster master", coordinates the activities of an indexer cluster. It also handles updates for indexer clusters.
 The search head cluster deployer handles updates for search head clusters.

Job(s) of Splunk Software

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 The same software can be search head, indexer, deployer, license manager,  The stanza configuration determines the functions and capabilities

Cluster Master
Rana Nujaidi

What is Cluster Master?

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 A Cluster Master manages a cluster of indexers which can indexes multiple copies of the data

 2018 SAUDI ARAMCO

Explaining What It Does
 The Cluster Master coordinates the activities of the peer nodes.a
 Peer nodes' configuration  Replication Activity  Search head direction to peer nodes  Peer nodes status Monitoring

Bundle Replication

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 2018 SAUDI ARAMCO

Bundle Importance
What can go wrong

1. Broken Buckets 2. Cluster Master Failure 3. Misconfigured Bundles

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Broken Buckets
 Storage disconnection  Indexer failure  Network interruption

Cluster Master Fail
 Server error  Network interruption  Server Failure

Deployer
Michael Gilliam

The purpose
Why is it necessary?

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Distribute apps to cluster members
 It handles migration of app and user configurations into the search head cluster from noncluster instances and search head pools.
 It deploys baseline app configurations to search head cluster members.  It provides the means to distribute non-replicated, non-runtime configuration updates to all
search head cluster members.
The deployer is not a search head cluster member
 2018 SAUDI ARAMCO

What Can It Do?

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 New or upgraded apps.
 Configuration files that you edit directly.
 All non-search-related updates, even those that can be configured through the CLI or Splunk Web, such as updates to indexes.conf or inputs.conf.
 Settings that need to be migrated from a standalone search head. These can be app or user settings.

 2018 SAUDI ARAMCO

So What Could Possibly Go Wrong?

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Updates from the GUI are stored in local, so always will take precedence  Unique names are necessary  The bundle must contain ALL the apps to be deployed
 If the state must be enabled in app.conf for the app to be removed
 User attributes cannot overwrite already existing system settings  When the election process fails
 (talking about Splunk here, not presidential elections)
 Trouble shooting heart beat failures
 How to detect them.  Why they may happen  How to fix them.

 2018 SAUDI ARAMCO

Key requirements

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Each member must run on it's own machine, or virtual machine  All machines must run the same operating system  All members must run the same version of Splunk  All members must be connected to a network  The deployment must be the replication factor or three, whichever is greater

Deployer should never be used to perform production searches

Deployment Server
Rana Nujaidi

Who & what does it control?

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 A deployment server distributes configuration to deployment clients, who can be universal/heavy forwarders, indexers, or search heads
 It controls the configuration for deployment clients through server classes

 2018 SAUDI ARAMCO

What should be done?

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Change the phonehome default settings  You don't need to communicate with your forwarders all the time
 CAREFUL with the number of connected deployment clients  Don't take advantage of "reload" command  Ship your logs directly to Indexers (why bother the heavy forwarders)

Upgrading Process
Michael Gilliam

The situation
Don't make assumptions

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
1. Operating system *nix 2. Do not have root access
 So cannot just install binary
3. Window manager such as GNU Screen 4. All devices have the same install script 5. Splunk install file saved same location

One method for getting the file distributed

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 2018 SAUDI ARAMCO

 Upload info  Retrieve instructions  Download Splunk  Save locally

Now all at once
Proper preparation, reduce execution
 Login to half the servers  Indexers need maintenance mode
 Shutdown Splunk  Run install script
 Verifies Splunk down  Stop the Splunk if necessary  Verify $SPLUNK_HOME  Extract the files  Start Splunk, accept license  Report Splunk status

Security & Performance
Rana Nujaidi

Being secure without impacting operations

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Importance of setting different password  Changing port number for additional security  Consider configuring using SSL
 The configuration and possible complications  Troubleshooting SSL problems

 2018 SAUDI ARAMCO

Finding what's bad
 Identify the corrupted bucket,  If it's a main buckets, GOOD LUCK with repair  If it's a backup buckets, a simple delete command

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 2018 SAUDI ARAMCO

Fixing corrupt buckets
 Be lazy  Wait for an error to occur
 Be Proactive  Run a monthly search to verify the health of the buckets

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 2018 SAUDI ARAMCO

Commands to locate
1. From the clustermaster interface: | dbinspect index=<index> index=<index> host=* corruptonly=true | streamstats count BY bucketId
2. Identify the corrupted buckets

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 2018 SAUDI ARAMCO

Syntax to fix the problem(s)
3. switch the cluster master to maintenance mode 4. offline the peer with corrupted bucket
a. if corrupted bucket is backup copy: simply delete b. if corrupted bucket is main copy:
$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk fsck \ repair --all-buckets-one-index \ --index-name=<index>

Parallelization

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Batch mode search parallelization  Additional search pipelines
 Parallelization summarization for data models  Concurrent data model acceleration searches
 Parallel summarization for report acceleration  Concurrent report acceleration searches
 Index parallelization  Concurrent data processing pipelines on indexers and forwarders

 2018 SAUDI ARAMCO

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Batch Mode Search
Parrelization

 Return event data by bucket  By increasing batch search pipelines,   speeding the return of search results

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Data Model accelerations

 By increasing the number of scheduled acceleration searches per datamodel  increase of IO, processing, and memory used on every indexer.

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Report accelerations

 By increasing the number of scheduled acceleration searches per report  increase of IO, processing, and memory used on every indexer.

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Index Parallelization

 By increasing the parallelization to 2  use additional 4-6 CPU cores, and requires 300-400 IOPS to maintain indexing throughput on every indexer  fewer CPU cores available for search processing

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Putting it all together
Michael Gilliam

Be prepared
Standby

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Cluster master  Deployer  License master  Deployment server (good luck with redirecting all forwarders to the new server)

 2018 SAUDI ARAMCO

Cold Standby
 Wait till you get an issue  Requires additional server  Restore the files from backup  Takes the most time to implement
 No external modifications
 2018 SAUDI ARAMCO

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Warm Standby
Exact Copy
 Have a duplicate server  Monitor the files on the master  Copy the updated files from
Active  Failover  assign master's ip
 Faster than cold

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Warm Standby
Impersonating the original
 Control access with either DNS or load-balancer
 Copy the files across both servers  Assign a server as master  Failover  Activate standby server

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Warm Standby
Reconfiguring everyone else
 Have a duplicate server  Copy the updated files from
master  Monitor files on the master
 Make the necessary changes  Failover configure
infrastructure to new master

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Things to keep in mind

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Multiple clusters does not have to be tedious  Proper planning + Successful implementation = FUN  It's possible to increase assets without adding manpower, when done correctly
