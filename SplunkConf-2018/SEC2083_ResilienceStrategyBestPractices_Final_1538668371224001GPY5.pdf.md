Rapid Response Requires Network Context

 What is the device with IoC?

 Where is the device?

 Where can the attacker

traverse to?

IoC

 How can they get there?

 What containment options

are available?

Rapid Response Requires Network Context
 Network Context Speeds Response  Pull Plug- Need L2 information  Kill Switch- L2 information  Honeypot- Path and L2  Deploy IDS- L3 Path  Change ACL- L3 Path & FW

Resilience In Action | WannaCry Example
What if you had 10,000 wannacry violations?
Resilience knowing asap which ones will take you down, knowing exactly how to fix them, staying in business
Or you could pull all the plugs and be headline news

The Bottom Line

YOUR JOB RESPONSIBILITY HAS
CHANGED
Hackers Are In. Protection and detection are necessary, but clearly
not sufficient.

THE REQUIREMENT HAS ELEVATED
Resilience. Must be built into the infrastructure to speed investigation and mitigate
damage.

FOUNDATIONAL KNOWLEDGE CRITICAL
Network Context. Is everything. You need to know your infrastructure better than your attacker,
before they attack.
