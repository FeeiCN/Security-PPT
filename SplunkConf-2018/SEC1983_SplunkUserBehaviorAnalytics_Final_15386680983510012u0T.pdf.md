Preparation & Installation
Best Practices to install UBA

Datasource Identification
Use-case driven approach

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Event data
 Always start with specific use cases that you would like to solve with UBA  Involve Security Architects/Infosec Engineers/SOC team for inputs  Use cases:
 Data Exfiltration  Lateral Movement  Account Compromise/Misuse  Compromised/Infected Machine  Suspicious/Unknown threats  Identify the data sources that would provide indicators to detect the use case and
verify if they are CIM compliant
 For example: Data Exfiltration -> Firewall, Web gateway/proxy, Email, Printer, USB etc.

Sizing
Sizing & deployment

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Sizing
 Scope for near future growth (minimum 2 - 3 years)  User population, additional logging/sources
 Factor in EPS (perc90) + user population + device count (workstations, servers, any other
devices on network)
 Hardware  Specs - Use the recommended specs to avoid additional configuration  Deployment - OVA/AMI preferred
 OS - Use supported OS version. If requirements do not comply, work with Splunk before the installation

Environment Preparation
Preparing for UBA installation

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Network  Get static IP(s) & register on DNS  Ensure firewall policies/restrictions between UBA nodes and to search-head(s)
 Splunk Enterprise/ES preparation
 Set up a UBA service account and assign appropriate privileges on the search-heads  Install sa-ldapsearch add-on and create a service account to login to Active Directory from
sa-ldapsearch (on-prem customers only) and test the connectivity  Enable SA-UEBA and go through the UBA setup process (may require restart)  Identify the list of sources that do not have non-CIM compliant TA's and fix them
 If switching to Kafka based ingestion, install Splunk UBA Kafka ingestion app

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Environment Preparation
Preparing for UBA installation
 UBA Internal  System Access - If you have tight policies,verify sudoers and ensure it complies to your
requirements
 Other information  Gather internal & publicly owned IP ranges across all your office locations  Identify SMTP server configuration for admin & analyst alerts

Data Onboarding
Getting data in

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Contextual Data
HR & assets data
 HR data  Why: Account Metadata Enrichment + Account Correlation + User Metadata Enrichment  Source: HR application/Active Directory  Field identification: Information that would assist in investigation  Data flow: Raw data -> lookup (report) -> UBA  Ingest -> Validate -> Reiterate till it is correct
 Assets data  Why: Device Metadata Enrichment  Source: CMDB/ES Assets/Active Directory  Data flow: Raw data -> lookup (report) -> UBA

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Event & Alert Data
Data sources that support use cases
 Data onboarding & validation  Test mode -> Validate -> Turn live  Types of logs  DHCP + DNS + WinEventLog:Security (DCs + workstations; powershell logging)  Network (internal-to-internal + internal-to-external; Netflow/NGFW/packet information)  HTTP traffic  Email/USB/Print/Cloud repositories  External Alerts (DLP/EPO/IDS/Malware/Phishing/SIEM)

Workflow Integration
UBA Post-Installation Best Practices

Environmental Feedback
Hunter workflow

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Scoring  Provide input on key assets or key users/departments to increase the risk score.
- ex: a user in `Research Lab' may carry more risk with data exfiltration than other departments
 UBA points out misconfigurations. If not correctable in near future, reduce the risk to avoid
white noise.
- ex: service accounts are used for interactive logins
 UBA exposes the scoring logic. If a specific scoring logic is not applicable to your
environment, adjust it upfront.
- ex: For excessive data exfiltration, UBA increases the score if it deviates from peer group profile. If peer group deviation is not applicable, adjust it accordingly.
 Suppression  Whitelist activity that may be behaviorally suspicious but may not be a concern
- ex: desktop support team logging onto unusual machines
 Whitelist known external entities for specific behavior
- ex: data transmission to an external organization(CIDR) that one of your teams is working with

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Approach to Investigation
Analyst workflow
 Adjust your investigative lens  Alerts are not generic across the environment. They are per entity.  Anomalies tend to be noisy. Focus on threats.
- ex: a user logging in over the weekend
 Verify anomaly relations and identify the common entity(ies) if multiple entities were involved
to start your investigation
 Avoid bias  Mask PII data
- authorized-to-do vs why
