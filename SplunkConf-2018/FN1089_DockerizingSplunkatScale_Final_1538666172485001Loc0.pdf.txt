Our Challenges

Splunk is still hard!

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

But really, how scary can it be?

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

How scary can it be?
 Rapidly going from a single standalone instance to a cluster is easy

Splunk and Containers

Major Platforms
Contain yourselves

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Major Platforms
It's a bit of the wild west out there

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Docker != Docker Swarm != Docker UCP != Kubernetes

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
People use containers differently

Major Platforms
We want to run splunk like.....

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Local laptops

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Docker container on a local laptop  Test Splunk as a standalone environment  Play around with the product and the configuration  Usually promote the configurations to bare-metal or orchestrator installs

People use containers differently!
 Docker Swarm  Installing Splunk in a smaller clustered environment  Want support for distributed (high availability) Splunk

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

People use containers differently!
 Kubernetes / Docker UCP  Installing Splunk in a larger clustered environment  Want support for distributed (high availability) Splunk  Want the complex functionality of dynamically scaling Splunk  Usually complicated and unpredictable/unknown data volumes

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

People use containers differently!

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Just a few requirements:
 Make Splunk easy to install on 1 environment, and have that same container be supported in bigger environments
 Allow splunk to be deployed in any of the complex configurations based on the users need
 Allow splunk to change configurations as I grow
 Allow all the upgrade paths of docker containers to function
 Persist my data for recovery / use on new containers
 Get the same supported package that Splunk support blesses today, inside of the container
 Do all of this, without me having to have in-depth knowledge of the product
 One more thing, make it work on Kubernetes....

Major Platforms

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

So this is where we tell you about ORCA?

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Last year we told you about our internal tool for configuring splunk and deploying to ec2, openstack, docker ucp, etc, and demo'd some cool stuff... And you all wanted it.
 We also had mentioned that it was going open source, and would be available hopefully soon. You know... a year ago could be soon, right?

 WHATS UP WITH THAT?

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
"We Decided You Don't Need ORCA "
There's a better way...

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Part 2: The Container Strikes Back
The New Shiny

Docker Container 1.0

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 The new docker container allows you to download and deploy on any major container software that supports docker images.
 The simplest configuration can be for standalone deployment, while the most complex supports search head clustering with index clustering.
 Service objects can now upgrade containers with newer versions, while still maintaining custom mount points.
 You can expand your deployments.
 You can mount your volumes to almost any directory.
 You can bring up cluster with docker-compose (or virtually any other orchestrator's deployment tool)
 We tried to maintain backwards support for the unsupported docker images.
 So hopefully your investment to the old open source container will still work
 Yes, it runs on Kubernetes.

Installation and Configuration
How do I use the darn thing?

Requirements
 Linux Kernel 4.9 or higher  Centos 7.5  RHEL 7.5  Fedora 25
 Docker Engine 17.06.02 or higher  UCP Enterprise Engine 2.2.11 or higher  x86-x64 Chipsets

Starting the instance from the command line

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Command line docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -e "SPLUNK_START_ARGS=--accept-license" -e "SPLUNK_PASSWORD=Chang3d!" splunk/splunk:latest
 You'll see the container start  Splunk Enterprise will not be available until the startup script finishes executing
 Use docker logs to follow the progress of the container

Docker Container 1.0
 How do we configure the container on the inside?  Ansible  Ansible is configuration management software  We've been using it in house for 2 years  All plays are run inside of the containers themselves  More resilient than BASH scripts  Easier to understand than BASH scripts  More flexible than BASH scripts  Please do not ask us to "write the configuration in BASH"

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

What happens under the hood?

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 The container starts  An entrypoint script is executed, that starts splunk and then runs ansible  We expect a default.yml file to contain the basic configuration  Included in the official documentation are examples and templates

 Another 30 minutes of very technical details.

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Data Persistence
Did you want to keep that?

Data Storage

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Data Storage
 Splunk is a stateful monolith  Right now data storage is tightly coupled to the configuration  Containers favor stateless micro-services  We're still evaluating the best way to persist data  The data volumes are specifically coupled to the containers role
 Ever had an index just disappear?  Ever had your search artifacts just disappear?  Specific issues may arise only within a container

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Data Storage
 Mount your data persistence volume to /opt/splunk/var  Indexes  Search Artifacts  Logs
 Docker and UCP  Use node affinities to restrict containers to certain nodes  Search heads tend to be memory bound  Indexers and search peers tend to be IO bound
 Look into how your orchestration layer handles volume mounts

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Troubleshooting
We can't all be perfect

Common Issues

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Getting your docker environment right is the first step  Are all of your ports mapped and exposed properly?
 If you're interacting with more external Splunk Enterprise elements, you will need more ports open
 Is your network configured properly?  Are all hosts reachable from the other hosts?
 Are all of the containers actually running?  OOM killers can terminate containers  Make sure that your hosts have adequate resources for your workloads  Set memory limits based on your workloads

Simple Debugging Commands

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 All of our ansible plays send their information to stdout/stderr on the container  Use docker logs
 You should see ansible output like this
