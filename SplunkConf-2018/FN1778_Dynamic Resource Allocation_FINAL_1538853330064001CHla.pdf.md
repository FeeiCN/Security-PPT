Workload Management
How does it help ?

Challenges
Unpredictability in search execution
Monitoring Console Scheduler Activity

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 New users run wildcard searches, all-time searches, real time searches  Users/apps running wildcard or expensive searches  Resource utilization goes through the roof and impacts other users  High search load impacts data ingestion lag and fails to fire alerts in time

Resource Allocation
Lack of control to align resource allocation with business priorities

Workload Management: Pool Creation

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Workload Pools  CPU/Memory resource pools  Specify allocation of CPU and
memory resources  Indicate ingest or search pool
First Version  One ingest pool  Multiple Search Pools

Workload Management: Rule Creation

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Workload Rules:
 Determines assignment of pools based on custom rules
 Rules can be specified on an app, role or user basis
 Rules order determines rule precedence
 Provision to provide more complex rules going forward

Monitoring

Dynamic Pool Selection: Ad-hoc Searches

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Dynamic Pool Selection: Scheduled Searches

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Scheduled Search Behavior across Workload Pools
 WLM Disabled
 WLM Enabled
 Scheduled searches run faster in higher resource workload pool  Fewer skipped searches in higher resource workload pool  Higher number of successfully scheduled searches in higher resource workload pool

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Ad-hoc Search Behavior across Workload Pools
 WLM Disabled
 WLM Enabled
 Ad-hoc searches run faster in higher resource workload pool  Higher number of successfully completed ad-hoc searches by concurrency in higher resource workload pool

Ingest Behavior across Workload Pools

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Increased ingest throughput under CPU load for higher resource workload pool  Throughput will be affected if resources are under-provisioned for Ingest pool  Parallel ingestion pipeline sets can help achieve better performance with sufficient
resource allocation for Ingest workload pool

Deep Dive
Setup, Configuration and Diagnostics

Setup
 Systemd
 Create a systemd unit file in /etc/systemd/system/systemd.service  Sample unit file available in the docs
 Run "systemctl daemon-reload" to reload the unit file  Run splunk start. This starts splunkd as a systemd service.  Verify that splunkd is running as a systemd service
systemctl status SPLUNK_SERVER_NAME.service
 Assign CPU for "splunk" cgroup
 Total system CPU shares in /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cpu.shares  Set CPU in
 /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/system.slice to 9126  /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/system.slice/splunkd.service /cpu.shares to 9126
 Assign physical memory for "splunk" cgroup
 Total system physical memory from /proc/meminfo  Set Memory in
 /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.limit_in_bytes to100% of total physical memory  /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/system.slice/memory.limit_in_bytes tp 90% of total physical memory  /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/system.slice/splunkd.service/memory.limit_in_bytes to 80% of physical memory

Sample Unit File
[Service] Restart=always Type=simple ExecStart=/root/rdimri/splunk/bin/splunk _internal_launch_under_systemd --accept-license --no-prompt --answer-yes --seed-passwd changeme Delegate=true
#Splunk defines successful exit codes other than 0 to indicate special exit scenarios which are #used by splunk operations like rolling-restart, offline etc. SuccessExitStatus=51 52 RestartPreventExitStatus=51 RestartForceExitStatus=52
#On some systemd installations, systemd does not create cgroups for memory and cpu controller under system.slice #rather it runs process under root cgroups, we can force systemd to create cgroups under system.slice by specifying #MemoryLimit and CPUShares, please look at description below. MemoryLimit=100G CPUShares=1024
#If you want to run splunk as non-root user uncomment the following four lines. PermissionsStartOnly=true User=splunk Group=splunk ExecStartPost=/bin/bash -c "chown -R <USER Specified above>:<GROUP of User> /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/system.slice/%n" ExecStartPost=/bin/bash -c "chown -R <USER Specified above>:<GROUP of User> /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/system.slice/%n"

Setup
 Non-Systemd (Initd)
 Set splunk root cgroup in workload_pools.conf
[general] workload_pool_base_dir_name = splunk
 Create cpu and memory cgroups
 sudo mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/<workload_pool_base_dir_name>  sudo mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/<workload_pool_base_dir_name>  sudo chown -R ${USER}
/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/<workload_pool_base_dir_name>
 sudo chown -R ${USER}
/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/<workload_pool_base_dir_name>
 Assign CPU for "splunk" cgroup
 Total system CPU shares in /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cpu.shares  Set CPU in /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/splunk/cpu.shares (80% of total cpu)
 Assign physical memory for "splunk" cgroup
 Total system physical memory from /proc/meminfo  Set Memory in /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/splunk/memory.limit_in_bytes (80%
of physical memory)

Configuration
 On a search head, perform the below steps through UI/CLI/REST  Create workload groups  Create workload rules  Enable workload Management  Check workload management status  splunk show workload-management-status  If search head is part of a search head cluster, changes are propagated to the other cluster
members
 Indexer Cluster Configuration  Copy workload_pools.conf from search head to the CM  CM location: $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/master-apps/_cluster/local directory  Execute CM bundle push from the CM

Interaction with Existing Search Quota Settings
 Existing search quota and scheduler priority changes continue to be applied along with Splunk Workload Management.
 Workload management does not attempt to override the settings described below.
