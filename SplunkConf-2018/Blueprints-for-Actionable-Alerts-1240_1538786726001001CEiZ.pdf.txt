 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Phase 1: Message of Concern

Attempted Solution
Basic Search => Spammy Alert

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
[Spam] action.email = true action.email.to = welovespam@spam.com counttype = number of events cron_schedule = */15 * * * * dispatch.earliest_time = -15min dispatch.latest_time = now enableSched = true quantity = 0 relation = greater than search = index=_internal error

Attempted Solution
Basic Search => Spammy Alert

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
[Spam] action.email = true action.email.to = welovespam@spam.com counttype = number of events cron_schedule = */15 * * * * dispatch.earliest_time = -15min dispatch.latest_time = now enableSched = true quantity = 0 relation = greater than search = index=_internal error

Message > Thresholds > Relative % > Averages > Percentiles > ITSI > Actionable Alerts

Result
4,436 errors over last 15min
#unrealistic

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Message > Thresholds > Relative % > Averages > Percentiles > ITSI > Actionable Alerts

Obvious Improvements
 Scope of problem is large  Solution: indexed fields (index, source, sourcetype, and/or pattern)
 Problem: "error" matches more than desired  Solution: bind with fields like log_level="error"
 Result: Stronger search ignores benign results

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Message > Thresholds > Relative % > Averages > Percentiles > ITSI > Actionable Alerts

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Phase 2: Thresholds

Attempted Solution
 Only alert if more than "arbitrary" # occurrences / time  Arbitrary = perception of healthy
 or...

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Message > Thresholds > Relative % > Averages > Percentiles > ITSI > Actionable Alerts

Result & Obvious Improvements
 Ignores variances of different types of errors  Web errors rarely happen but server errors happen often
 Fluctuations relative to usage  Threshold too small or large during peak or minimal usage, respectively  Static thresholds not adjusting with business growth or decline

Phase 3: Relative Percentages

What 2 Clean?

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Message > Thresholds > Relative % > Averages > Percentiles > ITSI > Actionable Alerts

New Concept
eval goal_attacking = coalesce( spam, system )

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Spam  Normalize against # of errors
 Ignore non error events
 log_level=ERROR

System  Normalize to all events
 Include all error + non error events
 log_level=*

 Good for clean up  Bad for permanent

 Good for permanent  Bad for clean up

Message > Thresholds > Relative % > Averages > Percentiles > ITSI > Actionable Alerts

Attempted Solution
Large % Items

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Message > Thresholds > Relative % > Averages > Percentiles > ITSI > Actionable Alerts

Result & Obvious Improvements
 Huge improvement  Less spam  Adjusts because normalized to volume
 What if that's normal?  Then persistent alerts that should be ignored = spam + noise!
 Percentage => Static => Arbitrary?!

Message > Thresholds > Relative % > Averages > Percentiles > ITSI > Actionable Alerts

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Phase 4: Average Errors

Attempted Solution
Current period vs historical average

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Message > Thresholds > Relative % > Averages > Percentiles > ITSI > Actionable Alerts

Result
 Adjusts with changes in environment!
 Slow  Summary Indexing?  Acceleration?
 How often alert?  Definition of average!

perc<X>(Y) = Returns the X-th percentile value of the numeric field Y, where X is an integer between 1
and 99. The percentile X-th function sorts the values of Y in an increasing order. Then, if you consider that 0% is the lowest and 100% the
highest, the functions picks the value that
18 corresponds to the position of the X% value. 19

Phase 5: Percentiles

Attempted Solution
 Current period's error rate vs. historical error rate  by error category (component)

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Performance?
Message > Thresholds > Relative % > Averages > Percentiles > ITSI > Actionable Alerts

The Lasso Approach
 Triage Strategy  Perimeter around errors  Tighten lasso by reducing percentile  Rinse & repeat

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Message > Thresholds > Relative % > Averages > Percentiles > ITSI > Actionable Alerts

Alternatives
 Address most common errors first  Start at 5th percentile and work up
 Normalization Frames:  Same errors  All errors  All events  Time windows (e.g. work hours)

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Message > Thresholds > Relative % > Averages > Percentiles > ITSI > Actionable Alerts

Result
 Adjusts with changes in environment!
 Requires Maintenance  Power User skillz  Summary Indexing
 Not period time adjusted  Fluctuations in business day or period
