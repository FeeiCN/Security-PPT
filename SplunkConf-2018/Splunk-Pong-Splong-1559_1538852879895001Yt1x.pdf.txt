Splunk+Pong = Splong! WAIT...We're not data scientists!

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

We just want to see Splunk play video games!

What to log?

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 The embedded Pong game comes with a basic AI that always tries to keep the ball in the middle of it's bat  We wanted to beat that.... at least most of the time
 We can beat the AI... Can we create a prediction model that plays like us?
 What do we know about the game of Pong that can make it easier to build this prediction model?

Bat Position

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Ball on Bat Position Ball incoming angle

There are other values that matter! Ball and bat speed, etc.

Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK)
 Numeric fields, Clustering, Time series, etc.
 Example use cases for MLTK:  predict median house values  forecast monthly sales  predict customer churn  detect outliers in IT Ops data

Processing the data models offline

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 We process the data offline by using Node and Splunk's javascript SDK and update the data in the javascript

Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK)
 MLTK is Splunk built and available for free at Splunkbase: https://splunkbase.splunk.com/

In Closing
 We wanted to showcase a simple approach to Machine Learning where data scientists are not needed and most importantly have fun!
 Using our own Splunked Pong data, we wanted to create a model in the Machine Learning Tool Kit to play (and hopefully win) against a rudimentary AI.

Pong2HEC
Sending events from the browser to Splunk
 Create an inputs.conf with a hardcoded token  allowQueryStringAuth!  Allows us to push events to a HEC
endpoint using jQuery.post()
 This is not a secure way of handling things...

Embedding Pong into a Splunk dashboard

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 We used an open source vanilla JS and HTML5 Canvas Pong implementation  https://github.com/SMenigat/html5-pong  First, convert a Splunk dashboard to HTML.  Then include the Pong JS library and embed the canvas.
