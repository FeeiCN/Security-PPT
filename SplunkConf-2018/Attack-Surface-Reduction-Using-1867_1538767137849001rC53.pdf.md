What is the attack surface?
The attack surface describes the company environment's exposure to attack across multiple vectors
 Numerous vectors exist within the enterprise, including both abuse of legitimate services, misconfigurations, vulnerable services, and others

Firewall / Network

Internal

DMZ

Server / OS

Application

Endpoint

User Behavior

More...

How can we reduce the attack surface?
Continuous maintenance is required to manage the attack surface

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Network / Firewall

Remove obsolete firewall rules, increase restrictions on firewall rules, introduce additional IDS/IPS filters, use static firewall rule analysis tools

Server / Operating System

Eliminate insecure configurations, enforce hardening baseline, conduct regular vulnerability scans, monitor server configuration drift

Endpoint

Increase endpoint protection coverage, prevent USB device connectivity

Application

Perform static code analysis, conduct regular application penetration tests, use automated code scanning tools

Challenge
Critical business processes may rely on insecure configurations, so insecure configurations must be eliminated gradually to avoid interruption of business activities. The original context for a configuration must be understood before removal, and often times documentation is unavailable

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Splunk Data Sources
Existing Splunk data can help understand the impact of changes to reduce the attack surface

Network / Firewall

Firewall Logs: identify unused or risky firewall traffic IDS/IPS Logs: identify rules allowing potentially malicious behavior

Windows Logs: ANONYMOUS LOGIN, interactive service account login, personal admin accounts Server / Operating System
Linux Logs: root login over SSH, anonymous FTP transfers

Endpoint

AV Operations: identify hosts without AV protection Host IDS: identify usage of USB devices in the network

Application

Firewall Logs: identify targets of application vulnerability exploits Application Logs: identify malicious URI strings

How Splunk Helps
Splunk provides a dynamic capabilities to understand the attack surface and prioritize actions

Contextual Enrichment

Splunk Enterprise Security provides asset and identity context, prioritizing the vulnerabilities which impact the most critical servers and users

Usage-based Prioritization

Splunk enables us to use activity history identify which vulnerabilities and misconfigurations are being used most frequently so they can be prioritized

Identify Legitimate Usage

Splunk enables us to correlate multiple sources to identify legitimate activity, such as which connections through the firewall result in successful server authentication

Continuous Monitoring

Splunk provides continuous insight into insecure processes within the environment, which may be missed between vulnerability scans

Sample Walkthrough
Permissive Firewall Rules

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Example Overview: Permissive Firewall Rules
 Firewall rule sets have developed over time in order to provide connectivity between business systems
 Improper firewall rules can allow more traffic than intended through the network, but removing firewall rules can disrupt critical business activities
 Static analysis tools may not help identify the legitimate traffic through an insecure firewall rule
 Iterative approach:  Identify a specific firewall rule based on defined criteria, such as most used, externally facing,
or other factors
 Deep dive into the traffic across the rule, and identify the highest traffic patterns  Break out rule into individual rules until original rule can be safely removed

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Identify a Rule to Focus
Select a specific firewall rule to analyze based on criteria
 For this example, we use a basic query to identify a permissive firewall rule

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Drilldown into Traffic for the Rule
Use Splunk to analyze the values of src, dest, and dest_port to identify common patterns
ACTION
For this example, create a new firewall rule to specifically cover DNS traffic

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Repeat!
Continue to identify "known good" traffic patterns until the remaining rule can be safely removed
 Use the most common traffic patterns to develop new rules, reducing traffic across the permissive rule. Examples of critical traffic to avoid blocking:  Active Directory communications  Antivirus definitions updates  Windows update processes  Critical users/critical machines activity
 Tip: try including src_category and dest_category to group traffic patterns

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Additional Suggestions
Additional ways to try to identify permitted traffic without legitimate justification and/or high risk
 Weight the results based on traffic which "ages out" without an established session, which would indicate the target system is not listening on the port
 Focus on traffic to/from business critical network zones, such as the industrial control systems or PCI domains
 Focus on traffic inbound to the network from external sources  Specifically target rules which are not frequently used on the network

Recap

Key Takeaways

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
1. Your existing Splunk data has valuable
insight into the configurations on your network  ACTION: Review your sources and identify where
Splunk data can help improve to your security posture
2. Your attack surface requires ongoing effort
to reduce insecure configurations  ACTION: Develop a plan to regularly review
activity in the environment for insecure configurations
3. Splunk Enterprise Security includes use
cases to identify prohibited traffic  ACTION: Configure your ES lookups and apply to
your data to find unexpected traffic patterns
