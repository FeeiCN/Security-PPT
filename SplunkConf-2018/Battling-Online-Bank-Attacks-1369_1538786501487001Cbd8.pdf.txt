Log Analysis within Internal System Environment
Detect Malware Infection

Detection of Malware Infection
Analyzing the proxying transmission destination
 Aggregate the date and time of proxy logs and find the suspicious internet transmission  Aggregate per FQDN of Transmission
Destination
 If no issue is found to the transmission
destination, it will be added to the whitelist, and excluded from the aggregation
Tips: Exclude white list traffic based on source ip / servers, then easily visualize C & C server communications

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Huge Access to VPS appeared all of the
sudden. Sender is potentially infected by malware

Detection of Malware Infection
Analyze Useragent from proxy logs

 Find the occurrence of any transmission to internet by suspicious Useragent
 Not IE, Edge, Chrome, Firefox
 No UA
 Old version of browser
 No precedent UA cases
Tips: UserAgents give us hints whether they are malware/C&C communications

Unusual UA. Register UA that regularly appeared into whitelist and exclude from
aggregation enables monitoring unusual cases

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Detection of Malware Infection
Analysis of AD event log
 Aggregate per event code and check if there is any usage of suspicious account  Usage of unexpected privilege ID
- 4672
 Below is the failure of event code authorization
- 46254672476847714776
 Event code that doesn't appear in regular
operation
- 46184649471947654766etc
Very effective by just aggregating event code and confirming the date and time

Visualize suspicious accounts by count, event
code and time/date

Analysis of Online Traffic
Detect unauthorized access from unusual traffic

Detection of Unusual Traffic
Analyze access log by status code
 Except normal status codeex. 200 304, aggregate and confirm unusual status request
By grasping daily baseline, unusual patterns can be recognized

Too many requests for 404 status, it could
be DDoS and vulnerability scan

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Detecting Unusual Traffic

Other Methods of Analyzing Access Log

 Aggregate the number of access sources/IP addresses by day
 Approx. 20,000 Addresses/Day

 Aggregate the access number for each country by day
 Approx. 100 Countries/Day

 Aggregate the number of requests for each country by day

Either way, there is a regular trend

Country names

Detection of Unusual Traffic
Trend Analysis from the countries where there is not a lot of regular access
 By excluding the major countries, aggregate only the request from the countries where there are no regular access

Sudden access from Guatemala, It was SQL injection attack

Sudden access from unusual countries shows potential attack

Country names

Detecting Suspicious Access
Monitor Useragent that regular browsers are not used

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Monitor suspicious Useragent as staged below, and block wrongful access if it is not legitimate  Unexciting UA such as IE11.0 Formally rv:11.0  Browser that is used by certain countries  Command system such as wget, curl. etc.  Suspicious tool such as Go-http and access from vulnerability scanners

How to Detect Phishing Site
Finding out phishing site generated wrongfully from access logs

Detecting Phishing Site
Possible to find out before a criminal spreads out to the phishing site
 Check domain names of Referer that belong to online banking access log and confirm if there is any access from similar domain names that are similar to own domains.
 Most phishing sites are referring to original image, CSS, JS, etc. if so, URL of phishing site remains in Referer of original content's logs
Needs caution for requesting only images but not for html

URL of phishing site

HTML is the criminal's content, but the image is
referred to the original

Detecting phishing site
How to analyze Referer

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Cannot check all Referer everyday, check by extracting Referer domain names newly appeared the day before Referer by using Title Get Tool

Extract the difference
Yesterday's Referrer

Narrow down to approx. 50
cases/day

New Referer List

All Rererrer Domain
Name that appeared in
the past

The result of Title Get Tool. If domain name is similar with the own domain or IP address, needs caution

How to Handle Phishing Site

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Request National CERT to close phishing site
 Report unsafe sites from each browser
 Enter fake (Non-existing) account into phishing site, block access to use the fake account by using IP address
 Let Referer redirect the request with phishing site URL to another page prepared by bank  Even though customers have accessed to phishing site, it is still possible to display
the bank's page

Analysis of Open Port IP

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Confirm if there is any designated Open Port to IP address at the time of login. Alert if the IP address has not been used in the past for each account
 Since criminals often use VPS, someone else's server and router in order to access, there are
cases that they might use IP address available remote Open Port as stated below
 22, 1723, 3389
 Schedule alert in every 15 minutes. Check all histories of login that occurred during the time
You can obtain Open Port information from external site such as SHODAN, censys, etc.
 Confirm if the VPS is used by our customers or not

Detecting Hacked Account Logins
Analysis of Cookie
 Issue Unique Key Value per Cookie, Check log into multiple accounts by the same key valueSame Key ValueSame TerminalSame Browser Alert if the same terminal is used to log into multiple accounts
 It is extremely unusual to log into multiple accounts from the same terminal/same browser
since each one has the same single account
- If it is used within the same company or same family and share PC, there is no issue. Thus it is excluded from alert
 Schedule alert for every 15 minutes. Check all histories of log in that are occurred every 60
minutes
 Various hacking cases are detected. For example, commonly purchasing accounts, etc.

How to Detect the Infection of Banking Trojan
Detect if the customer's PC is infected by banking trojan

Detection of Infection to Banking Trojan

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Detect if a customer is infected by banking trojan
 If the terminal is infected by banking trojan, it requests for non-existing path of bank WEB site
/jqueryats/, /uejei3j/, /iimgc/, etc.
 By analyzing the request for 404 status, we recognized there were many requests for same path
 Suspicious parameters such as bank= and account= Query Parameter are attached to query parameters

Suspicious Path
Suspicious Query Parameter

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Detection of Banking Trojan Infection Detect if a customer is infected by banking trojan
 Recognized that fraudulent beneficial information was included once query parameter was URL decoded
 All Destination IP Addresses requesting for this pass have terminals infected by banking trojan
 Within status 404 request, needs caution for any requests with suspicious query parameters such as account=, password=, etc.

These IPs are infected by bank trojan

Fraudulent beneficial account name and amount of remittance, etc.

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Reference Request for Banking Trojan
The reason why Banking tojan sends a request to Banking Site
 Banking trojan is pretending to be transmitting to bank server for the transmission of C&C server (Request to jqueryats, etc.)
 Disguised transmission is hooked by banking trojan and yielded to C&C server, yet it ends up as failure by depending upon the end-user's environment
 If it is failure, it just requests to bank server

 How fast to detect appearances of your phishing site  Leverage Refere-domain field and identify if it is phisling site or not
 How fast to detect hacked accounts  Browser langueage gives us hints for each accounts  Leverage cookie information if the customers' PC is used by multiple users
 How fast to detect banking malware on PCs  Check if there are many requests to non-exsisting path of your bank web site
