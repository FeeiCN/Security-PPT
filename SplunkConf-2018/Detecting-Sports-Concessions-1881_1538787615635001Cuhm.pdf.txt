Purpose
Our Goal.

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 We created ForceIntellisense to provide robust data analytics using a platform we all know and love!
 Goal was to simplify the to detection and analytic capabilities of the forces of movement.
 Our proprietary computational algorithms detect the specific pattern of concussive movements to determine the likelihood a concussion occurred.

 We aim to reduce the factor of diagnostic error in athletic injury analysis, particularly regarding forceful impact to the head and neck area.

Let's take a deeper dive...

Research
The problem.

Research
The Problem.

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 The area of research in relation to brain injury detection is still relatively new and untapped.
 Estimated that 5-10% of athletes will experience a concussion in any given sports season.
 Football is the most common sport with concussion risk for males at 75%.
 78% of concussions occur during games as opposed to practices.
 Estimated 47% of athletes do not report feeling any symptoms after a concussive blow causing symptoms go untreated.
 CDC estimates that 1.6 million to 3.8 million concussions occur each year overall.

Current Event

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Just a few days ago, a high school football player in Georgia named Dylan Thomas passed away due to a head injury sustained during a game.
 No one knows exactly when during the game the head injury occurred.  At first the injury was perceived to be a leg injury due to Dylan complaining of
numbness in his legs, and later his entire body. Shortly after Dylan passed out and was rushed to the hospital where they discovered swelling of the brain.  Unfortunately, brain injury related deaths happen much too frequently.
 Our goal is to prevent tragic accidents like this from happening.

Why we use Splunk?
How we're different.

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Each of our sensors can natively run Splunk on-board!

 Allows us to visualize the real-time data using Splunk dashboards and reporting capabilities.

 Ability to run our time-based calculation algorithms on a cloud based architecture.

Competitive Advantage
How we're different.
 ForceIntelliSense focuses on real-time, accurate analysis of impact on an athletes body. `
 Our biggest advantage is our advanced algorithm, speed of categorization, real-time visualizations of the data, and access to data from anywhere that has an internet connection over WiFi.
 Designed on a distributed architecture not based on a singular data collection device.
 Sensors capable of buffering time stamped data if/when network becomes unavailable.
 Data analysis available on Mobile devices via Splunk Cloud.

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Intelligent Impact Monitoring
 Real-time collection of impact data
 Specific algorithms to detect concussive signatures.
 Ability to provide a centralized impact monitoring service.
 Accessibility of data from any network connected mobile computing device.
