How Do I choose the Right Path?

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Cost Considerations  Resources  Financial  Personnel
 Organizational Knowledge  Does your organization have people that truly "know" what to do?  Extensive operational experience  Comprehensive Existing Workflows/Playbooks
 Enterprise Resources  Is there any resistance to automating certain actions (such as blocking IP's or domains
automatically)?
 Does your security team have access to (or have the buy-in of IT) to implement the
automations you are looking to do?

I've Settled on a Path, Now What?

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 With all paths:  Ensuring there is an understanding regarding the following:  Expected Deliverables  SLA's/SLO's  Continuous Improvement Plan
 If leveraging a managed service or purchasing a preconfigured offering:  Balancing Expectations Vs. Realities  You are not the only client...
- ...however, you can leverage the collective knowledge gained by others
 If Building Your own or Leveraging External Contractors  Defining your automation goals and benchmarks  Determining what is in-scope and out-of-scope  Do I implement an automated block or do I automate a notification to an engineer for validation?

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Where Not to Begin your Automation Journey
 Buy a product/solution without an implementation plan  Avoid buying "shelfware"  Review existing documented processes  Validate organizational knowledge of existing platforms  Define # of FTE available for automation management
 Trying to automate everything on day one  Prioritize your automations using the following criteria:  Is the workflow repeatable?  Is there an API or script?  Is it Time-Consuming?

Tactical VS Strategic Automation
 Tactical Automation  Individual Tasks or Workflows
 Strategic Automation  Combination of multiple automated workflows
