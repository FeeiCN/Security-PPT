1. Semi-structured text a. Typical machine data b. Possibly some structure (e.g., key=value, JSON)
2. Tabular a. (row, column) = value
3. Matrix a. All numbers b. No missing values

Identify the Data
relevance and sufficiency

Example Dataset
 Donut shop  Point-of-sale system from brick & mortar store  Transaction data from online sales (coffee, gear)

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Identify the Data
 Labels  Do you have examples of the task being performed correctly?
 Relevance  Would the information help a human perform the task?
 Completeness  Do you need to integrate multiple datasets?
 Weighting  Is older data less valid or useful than recent data?

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Data Integration
 Joins are natural (cf. SQL)  But, Splunk is not optimized for joins, so they are inefficient  Preferable to use OR  e.g., Correlating user logins & logouts by session ID

Data Splitting

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Class Imbalance
Definition

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 In classification / anomaly detection, you have classes you are trying to predict, e.g.,  Valid / Fraud  Normal / Anomaly  Success / Failure
 Class imbalance refers to wildly different class frequencies  e.g., 99.999% valid; 0.001% fraud
 If we don't handle it correctly, our model will have trouble learning about the minority classes  e.g., no examples of the rare class appear in the training data

Summary

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Machine learning wants clean data (usually a matrix)
 Machine data begins life dirty  Relevant data scattered across sources  Missing values, incorrect values, wonky formats  Class imbalance
 Splunk Enterprise and MLTK provide many tools for preparing data for ML  Field extraction, joins, and lookups  Fit algorithms like StandardScaler and FieldSelector  Commands like eval, sample, and fillnull
