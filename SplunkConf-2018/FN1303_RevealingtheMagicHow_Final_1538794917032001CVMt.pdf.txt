A little bit about myself
6+ years at Splunk

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Historical Performance
Since .conf2016

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 We're nearing a 50% decrease in search times since Splunk 6.5
 Based out off internal test suite of 80 searches ranging in:  Density  Commands  Duration  1s to 30 minutes

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Todays Agenda
Pretty Simple

1. Splunk is way faster in 2018 than 2016 2. How did we achieve this

3. How can you take advantage of it

Data Serialization
In Splunk 7.1

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Indexers forward search results to the Search Head utilizing the CSV file format
 CSV is text based  Everything needs to be converted into strings
 CSV is verbose  Those commas can add up, not the kind of BIG DATA we're after  Yes it's compressed but this eats into encoding time

Search Results Serialization
New to Splunk 7.2
 Introducing the SRS file format
 New binary serialization format for search results
 Aims to solve the short comings of CSV files  Transmission file size  Encoding performance  Time to first read

 Values within fields often repeat  status=200  method=GET
 SRS dedupes repeated values
 Leads to the compressor having to do less work

Key 1 2 3 4 5

String access_log prod_1 staging_1 prod_2 prod_3

 To further reduce file size SRS utilizes string pools
 Pools contain unique strings by lookup id
 Events then point pool for string reference
 Leads to much less ram utilization during decode

Search Results Serialization
Event Type Support
 SRS retains type information for event values  Strings, Integers, Floats, Multivalued
 Encodes numbers with variable length encoding (LEB128)  1532355229 encodes to 40 bits as a number  "1532355229" needs 80 bits when left as a string
 Leads to large gains in encode and decode performance  Float types will see the greatest benefits

 SRS serializes in column-major fashion
 Splunk doesn't need to wait for all rows to be sent before working on a column
 Analogous nature of column data leads to compression benefits

See for Yourself

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

$ cd var/run/splunk/dispatch/$sid $ ls -l
events generate_preview info.csv metadata.csv peers.csv remote_logs results.csv.gs > results.srs.gs search.log

 SRS can be seen in the dispatch folder on the Search Head
 csv extension from results is replaced with srs

Search Results Serialization
New Commands

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

$ splunkd toCsv results.srs.gz $ splunkd toSrs results.csv.gz

 SRS is not readily parsable
 New commands to convert between the two result types
 Useful for scripts which did post search processing on CSV results

Search Results Serialization
Enabled by Default

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

$ vim etc/system/local/limits.conf
~ [search] ~ results_serial_format=srs

 SRS is enabled by default in Splunk 7.2
 Togglable through limits.conf file
 Both Indexer and Search Head need to be enabled  Graceful fallback to
csv otherwise

Compression in Splunk
Gzip From the Beginning
 Splunk compresses raw event data on disk within the Journal
 Gzip has always been the default  First introduced in 1992
 L4Z compression option was added in Splunk 6.3  Increases compression rates by 6x  Increases decompression rates by 9x  Comes at the cost of 30% larger files  This tended to nullify any performance benefit

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Zstandard Compression
New Compression Option
 Announcing Zstandard compression support for Splunk 7.2  Developed by Facebook in 2015
 Average 5% space savings over Gzip
 Compression rate 4x improvement over Gzip
 Decompression rate 3x improvement over Gzip

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

$ cd etc/apps/$app/local $ vim index.conf

Zstandard Compression
See for Yourself

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

$ cd $index/db/$bucket/rawdata
$ ls -l journal.gz > journal.zst slicemin.dat slicesv2.dat

 New journals can be seen in the buckets rawdata folder on the Indexer

New Ingress Capabilities

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

$ vim transforms.conf
~ INGEST_EVAL =
<comma separated list of eval expressions>

 Save extracted fields as types other than strings  float, int, multival
 Can delete or replace existing fields
 Change the type of an existing field  "200 OK" > 200

Enhanced Eval
Landing in Splunk 7.2
 Typically memory allocation is incredibly quick  However over millions events this can actually become a bottleneck
 Memory management improvements to eval engine  Reduced the need to copy results from one process to another
 Performance boosts will grow as the size of the data set increases  | search len(_raw) > 1000

Metric Store
Historical Overview
 First shipped in Splunk 7.0 as a new storage type

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Leverages structured data to improve search performance  Nearly a 200x improvement over Splunk 6.6 in certain instances

 Comes at the cost of a more restrictive query interface via |mstats command

Extra Credit

 Great .conf talk on Metric Store from earlier in the week
 FN1096 - Metric Indexes: Architecture and Usage  Video and PowerPoints will be online shortly at conf.splunk.com

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Why Metrics
Splunk Seemed Pretty Good Already
 TSIDX comes in two forms  "Classic" edition for basic |search queries  MSIDX for |mstats commands
 TSIDX only supported strings
 MSIDX addressed this with support for 64-bit floats

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

MSIDX V2
Shipped in Splunk 7.1
 Splunk 7.0 shipped with MSIDX V1  Implemented with minor modifications to existing TSIDX logic
 MSIDX V2 introduced in Splunk 7.1  Major reworking of the data structure

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
 Enabled by default for Splunk 7.1 onwards
 Newly ingested metrics will automatically be stored as V2  Existing metrics will be
need to be re-ingested to move to V2
