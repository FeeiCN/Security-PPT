Am I in the right session?

Agenda
 What are SVAs and why do they exist  Where you can find the content  Scope and Structure of SVAs  Example Scenarios  Future Plans for SVAs  Q&A

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Splunk Validated Architectures
A refresher on "what" and "why"

 2018 SPLUNK INC.
" Provide guidance on selecting proven reference architectures for stable, efficient and repeatable Splunk deployments."
Topologies & their characteristics, and deployment best practices

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Primary Goals
Why we care

1. Put your Splunk deployment on a solid
architectural foundation
2. Meet your requirements exactly at
minimal TCO
3. Focus resources on value realization,
instead of fixing Splunk

Phased Development Approach
SVAs will evolve over time
 Phase 1: Focused on Indexing and Search Tiers
 Phase 2: Added Data Collection Tier components
 Phase 3: Making SVAs interactive
 Phase 4: Integrate with sizing calculators

Problem & Solution
And who can benefit

Why SVAs?
The problem that needs solving
 Splunk deployments need a proven architectural foundation  Supportable  Scalable  Meeting Requirements  Best TCO
 "Issues" impede adoption and value realization
 "Issues" costing resources to troubleshoot and fix

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

SVAs to the rescue!
How we address the problem

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 SVAs...  ...provide step-by-step guides and best practices, complementing our product documentation  ...empower you to architect, deploy and operate according to proven best practices  ...result in more stable, efficient and repeatable deployments...  ...that meet your requirements  ...will ensure your success with optimal TCO  ...will allow you to shift your resources from "analyze & fix" to "adopt & delight"

Who should care?

Scope & Structure
What SVAs cover and how to read them

SVA Scope
A quick tour
 SVAs DO...  ...address topology selection for indexing and search tiers  ...address data collection mechanism selection and architecture  ...provide best practices and design principles for implementation
 SVAs DO NOT...  ...contain sizing guidelines  ...address detailed deployment choices (OS, Cloud, etc)  ...cover every possible customer scenario

SVA Structure
A quick tour
 The SVA document will guide you through a 3-step process:

Example Scenarios
Walking through real-world examples

Use Case 1: New Deployment
 Brand New! Deployment..  100gb/day  Network Data Sources  No HA / DR for anything

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Use Case 1: Topology Selection

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

https://www.splunk.com/pdfs/white-papers/splunk-validated-architectures.pdf

Use Case 1: Topology

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Use Case 1: Data Collection
 Identify required collection components via the second questionnaire  for this use case, let's assume you need Syslog data collection only

" One of the things I always found hardest to understand about Splunk Architects was their habit of continually stating and
repeating the very very obvious, as in `This Gin is amazing', or `Adding more Indexers will fix that problem'."
Unknown CTO - The Hitchhiker's Guide to the SVAs

Use Case 2: New "Large Deployment"
 Brand New, "Large" Deployment  5tb/day, HA + DR requirements, Multi-DataCenter
deployment
 5000+ UFs / Endpoints

Use Case 2: Topology Selection

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Use Case 2: Topology

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Use Case 2: Data Collection

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Large Deployments like this typically require multiple different mechanisms to acquire and collect log data
 Identify those mechanisms using the second questionnaire  Pay attention to the critical considerations, as they will affect performance
 Consider management approach for data collection tier configuration

Use Case 3: Inherited "Buckets O' Fun"
 Existing Deployment  Maybe-- 2tb/day  3000+ UFs / Endpoints  Syslog Aggregates  DBX, AWS, OPSec LEA
