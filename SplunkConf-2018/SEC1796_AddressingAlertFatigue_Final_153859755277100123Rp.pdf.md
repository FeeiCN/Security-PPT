Level Setting
Words matter

Alert Fatigue

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Occurs when one is exposed to a large number of frequent alerts and consequently
becomes desensitized to them. Desensitization can lead to longer response
times or to missing important alarms.

Alerts Should Provide Value

Alerts Should Be Meaningful

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Alerts Should Be Actionable

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

All Alerts Are Not Created Equal

Some Alerts Are Straightforward

But it's Easy to get Lost
This isn't right

There Are Better Ways!

Event Sequencing

What is this Sorcery?

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 The Event Sequencing Engine provides additional capabilities for threat detection by allowing you to group correlation searches into clusters of events, either in a specific sequence, by specific attributes, or both.

 You do this by defining a workflow to run correlation searches in an order of your choice, specifying what notables would need to occur in order to advance to the next step.

 The concept is similar to writing a script to automate the things that you might otherwise have to do manually when tracking a variety of notables and variables through a variety of correlation searches.

Basic Structure
Define a starting event Define a set of transition events
 Order can be enforced Define an ending event

General Malware Behavior
Run a process never seen before Download an executable Visit a domain never visited before

Not Everything Qualifies as an Alert
Run a process never seen before  Any time you install something new
Download an executable from Internet  Happens all the time
Visit a domain never visited before  Happens frequently

Where Automation Can Help

 2018 SPLUNK INC.

INVESTIGATE
- Grab a copy of the binary - Detonate it - If determine to be malicious, remediate

REMEDIATE
- Isolate Machine - Deactivate Account - Notify IT to
restore from backup

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
- Kick off Investigation - Run Searches - Create your own threat intel

What Just Happened?
We can group individual events together  Event Sequencing  UBA
Leverage Automation  Reduce investigation time  Assist with remediation  Root Cause Analysis
