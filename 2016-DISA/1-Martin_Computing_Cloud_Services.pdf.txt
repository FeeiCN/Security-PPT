The Way Ahead (cont'd)

UNCLASSIFIED

Engineering Services
OPTIONS
Develop Storage-as-a- Service offerings
Converged Systems
Non-standard / Unique Hosting and Mission Partner Floor Space Rental

 Provide application rationalization & migration services  Offer shared/common services for capacity services
standard hosting and milCloud
 Full access to shared workspaces requires installation of the CTera Agent on the Client Computer or Mobile device
 Cloud storage service provides internet accessible file storage and document collaboration
 Continue support for ERPs and other converged systems  Charge full-cost recovery, rather than leveraging basic
services rates
 Remove UNISYS mainframe, AIX server, and Itanium (HP-UX) server from the service catalog
 Pursue rates that incentivize mission partners towards standard solutions
