Today, security is tied to a complex and rigid #RSAC network topology

And further complicated with three tier, consolidated application infrastructure
Web App DB

#RSAC
All of this results in a universal loss

Strain on Business
Missed Business Opportunities
Inability to adapt to market changes

Strain on Security
Security Compromises
Slow response to threats and changes

Security Posture

#RSAC
Use case: intelligent grouping for unsupported operating systems
OS no longer supported on several systems These systems need policy which restricts access to only email servers
Unsupported OS Group

UNIQUE POLICY DEFINITIONS
Policy and services defined with future changes in mind
Vulnerability scan. If vulnerability found, tag workload with CVE Score.

#RSAC
UNIQUE POLICY DEFINITIONS Remediate changes with preset policy definitions If tagged, remediate with IPS.

Automated Security in a Software Defined Data Center

UNIQUE POLICY DEFINITIONS
Policy & services defined with future changes in mind
Scan to ensure no private information is stored. If found, tag.

#RSAC
UNIQUE POLICY DEFINITIONS Remediate changes with preset policy definitions
If tagged, move workload to more secure PII group.

#RSAC
Summary

SDDC with NSX is fundamentally a more effective security solution

Removing grouping decisions from the network topology enables intelligent security decisions

NSX equips security teams with the ability to automate and adapt to changes
