What is the Internet of Things?
"The Internet of Things (IoT) is still somewhat of a vague concept and carries a number of definitions. The IoT in general refers to an Internet-like structure that connects uniquely identifiable objects, basically anything that can be tagged with an identifying chip. The "things" in the network take on virtual representations, and can interact with each other as well as gather data such as when and how objects are being used, their operating condition, etc."
http://www.csoonline.com/article/2134066/mobile-security/what-the-internet-of-things-means-forsecurity.html
 Does is it have to be connected to the Internet or even have an IP address?
 Interact only with other "things" (i.e., machine-tomachine) or can people be involved?
 Cynics would argue that IoT is an "invention" that's been in existence for decades

Useful to Think in Terms of Overall Process #RSAC

Collection (sensors, cameras, meters, GPS, measure glucose level)
Analysis (ingest, sort, transform, calculate)

IoT Support Functions

Core IoT Areas

Decisions (likely human interface, smart agents, triggers, decision support systems)
Action (actuators, drones, self-driving cars, pacemaker shocks, supply insulin)

Case Study: The "Uber" of the Future

#RSAC

Vehicle reports GPS position, cost data, charging status, etc.

Data on all cars is aggregated and sorted to deliver to customers
Customer selects vehicle and designated route with payment data on file and car is requested
Car receives request and autonomously travels to customer for pickup for arranged travel

Typical Use Cases  Identify outages  Billing  Reduce energy theft  Detect voltage drops  Remote connect /
disconnect  Demand response  Customer education  Marketing data

Building the Risk Model

Define Use Case

Identify all relevant impacts

Likely vulnerabilities

 Be as specific as possible
 Identify all components
 Note business objectives
 Create use case for each variation
 The "devil will be in the details"

 Start with the worst thing that can happen (e.g., loss of life)
 Make sure you include all relevant externalities (e.g., what would consumers or regulators think?)

 Start with all interfaces and potential attack surfaces including physical access
 May need to stay in the realm of what is reasonably foreseeable
 Make sure these are pared with impacts (i.e., certain vulnerabilities lead to certain impacts)

#RSAC
Identify threats
 Don't go overboard here
 Many threats have yet to materialize and are very speculative
 Use threats to help with impacts and vulnerabilities
 Threats will evolve significantly as incentives change and IoT becomes more common

13

Other Considerations

#RSAC

Externalities  Device owner or data custodian don't always
feel the bulk of the impact  Reputational harm only goes so far  Regulation should focus on where the harm
occurs

Iterate risk
model for each

Typical Stakeholders  Data subjects  Those using the devices (possible physical harm)  Public at-large / community  Device owners  Data custodians  Regulators (local, state, national, global)

#RSAC
Industry Options for Mitigating Risk
 Fit for purpose
 Sharply restrict use to only a particular applications, disclaiming liability (or making other uses illegal) for all else (e.g., drone only meant for agriculture observation in unpopulated areas)
 Generally unrealistic given tendency for usage to expand  May actually incur more liability
 Clearly document assumptions for device and its limitations
 Provide for close oversight where devices of different owners interact (e.g., vehicle to vehicle communications, adding energy resources to electric grid)
 Mandate vetted protocols and software libraries for devices that could involve human injury (particularly members of the general public)
 Implement device certification for particular use cases (e.g., safety, large amount of personal information, critical infrastructure)
16

Organization/Consumer Options for

#RSAC

Mitigating Risk

 Detailed use case development
 Be clear on the permissible uses (e.g., never use in control system environment)  Document data collection and retention policies  Assign oversight responsibility for each use case and involve people outside of IT
 Review insurance coverage and applicability
 Where possible, implement ongoing security monitoring
 Schedule ongoing reviews of Internet of Things implementation companywide and for each use case (this includes any new use of data collected)
 Revise risk management model and obtain necessary approvals after each change of scope (and you better believe that scope will change frequently)

17

Apply What You've Learned Today

#RSAC

 Next week you should:
 Begin to identify all current Internet of Things implementations that are in place, planned, or anticipated
 Identify any security policies or procedures related to Internet of Things

 In the next three months you should:
 Device owners should apply the risk model described and review results with management
 Identify mitigation steps and associated costs to achieve desired state

 In the next six months you should:
 Identify Internet of Things risks that you don't control that affect your organization
 Participate in industry groups to encourage development of security standards for the devices that most affect you
