generation and block ciphers
And then analyzed a large data set of common applications

SSL/TLS

#RSAC
Part I. Securing communications channels
Alice sends data to Bob

Internet

Alice

Bob sends data to Alice
Bob

Apps need to securely communicate with their backend servers. This can include sensitive user data. What can go wrong?

#RSAC
Part I. Securing communications channels
Alice sends data to Bob

Internet

Alice

Bob sends data to Alice
Bob

If the data being sent is not encrypted, anyone can read it. And they can also modify it by acting as a "Man in the Middle",
intercepting and replacing traffic as they see fit.

#RSAC
Part I. The SSL/TLS protocols
Alice sends data to Bob

Internet

Alice

Bob sends data to Alice
Bob

Encryption can ensure that only the endpoints can read or write the data transferred over the connection. So let's do that.

#RSAC
Part I. The SSL/TLS protocols
Alice sends data to Bob

Internet

Alice

Bob sends data to Alice
Bob

But how does Alice know that she is talking to the real Bob?

This is a job for PKI.

#RSAC
Part I. The Public-Key Infrastructure
Alice sends data to Bob

Internet

Alice

Bob sends data to Alice
Bob

But how does Alice know that she is talking to the real Bob? Because he has the right public key.
But how does she know Bob's public key? A trusted third party (TTP) vouches for his identity.

#RSAC
Part I. The Public-Key Infrastructure
Alice sends data to Bob

Internet

Alice

Bob sends data to Alice
Bob Identity verification using a TTP:

 Bob creates an unsigned certificate that specifies his public key  After verifying Bob's identity, TTP signs the certificate using its private key  When Alice connects, Bob sends the signed certificate to prove his identity.  Alice verifies the TTP's signature and that Bob is using the specified key

#RSAC
Part I. The Public-Key Infrastructure
Alice sends data to Bob

Internet

Alice

Bob sends data to Alice
Bob

Note that Alice must:
 Check that the presented certificate is in fact for Bob, and not Charlie  Validate that the certificate is properly signed by a TTP

Part I. The Public-Key Infrastructure

A "Man-in-the-Middle" Attacker able to impersonate Bob again gets full access to the communication

#RSAC
Part I. Android (Java) capabilities
Trust management for SSL/TLS
javax.net.ssl.SSLContext
.init(KeyManager[], TrustManager[], SecureRandom)
The TrustManager parameter allows a custom class to be used for verifying the server's certificate. This has some legitimate uses, e.g. for "pinning" a specific trusted certificate.
Problem: Defining a custom TrustManager that is too accepting (e.g., takes any certificate) to work around SSL errors. This allows an attacker to use any certificate (even self-signed) to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
Solution: Try to avoid overriding this option. Scrutinize custom Trust Managers carefully to ensure that they perform sufficient checks or are only used in debug/testing mode.

#RSAC
Part I. Android (Java) capabilities
Trust management for SSL/TLS
javax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection
.setHostnameVerifier(HostnameVerifier v)
Specifies a custom hostname verifier that can permit certificate hostnames that do not match the DNS host name
Problem: Defining a custom HostnameVerifier that is too accepting (e.g. of any hostname) to work around SSL errors. This allows the attacker to use a valid certificate for his own domain to become a man-in-the-middle.
Solution: Try to avoid overriding this option. Scrutinize custom Hostname Verifiers carefully to ensure that they perform sufficient checks or are only used in debug/testing mode.

#RSAC
Vulnerabilities are sometimes not your fault
 Crypto is hard to get right, even for experts  OpenSSL is the most popular crypto library, and has a history of
severe vulnerabilities with cute names. Some are implementation bugs, others are protocol design flaws.  If you package your own crypto library with your app, it is important to keep it up to date.

#RSAC
OpenSSL vulnerability du jour: FREAK
 Attack spoofs the communication endpoints into using weak, "export" grade ciphers (remember those?)
 Both client and server must be vulnerable to exploit  11.2% of apps on Google Play with over one million downloads
were vulnerable to FREAK as of last month
 They connect to a vulnerable server  They use Android's built-in OpenSSL implementation or package their
own vulnerable version

#RSAC
Data Encryption

#RSAC
Part II. Encrypting data: Why?
 Encryption makes it difficult for a malicious entity to read sensitive information on the device
 Data stored on the filesystem, in memory, or even the SD card
 Encryption allows sensitive data sharing with untrusted parties
 Data encrypted by an endpoint device can be kept private even from a service provider that stores or transfers the data

Foobarbaz Quxluxtux Foobarbaz ...

O = f(I, K)

d34df216e9... 9a3f374ed6... d34df216e9... ...

Identical inputs (I) get encrypted using key (K) to identical outputs (O)! Algorithm is stateless, and thus gives a trivial attack.

Overall goal: make it computationally infeasible to break the crypto

O1 = f'(I1, K, IV) O2 = f'(I2, K, O1) O3 = f'(I3, K, O2) ...

K and IV are used to encrypt O1 K and O1 are used to encrypt O2 K and O2 are used to encrypt O3 etc.

Algorithm is stateful. Additional input to each block means identical blocks differ. The IV is used to ensure that similar or identical messages will have no similarities in cyphertext

Overall goal: make it computationally infeasible to break the crypto

Given appropriate function f', inputs are indistinguishable under chosen plaintext attack, offering a strong security guarantee.
Overall goal: make it computationally infeasible to break the crypto

#RSAC
Part II. Android (Java) capabilities
Encryption mode
javax.crypto.Cipher.getInstance(String transformation)
The Cipher class is a general mechanism for obtaining instances of different cryptographic block ciphers in various operation modes, with a string of the form algorithm/mode/padding
Problem: The mode "ECB" is stateless and vulnerable to chosen plaintext attack. The other, stateful modes are only IND-CPA secure if a randomized initial vector is used
Solution: Use a stateful mode like "CBC" or "CTR". Use a securely random (high entropy) value for the initial vector each time.

Safe stateful encryption
Use both stateful and stateless encryption Stateful but with static Initial Vectors Purely stateless encryption

Apps in red and orange use encryption modes or parameters that are not secure against chosen plaintext attack

#RSAC
Part II. Android (Java) capabilities
Encryption key selection
javax.crypto.Cipher.init(...,Key key,...)
Cipher class is initialized with a passed-in key
Problem: The key should not be a fixed value, where it could be recovered from one device and used to decrypt data from another device.
Solution: Reliably protecting data belonging to the user requires use of a user-specific key that is not stored persistently on the device, such as a password-based key. But a password-based key should be hashed with many iterations to make password-guessing attacks impractical.

Keys are not statically defined
Static keys in apps with stateless encryption
Static keys in apps with only stateful encryption

Orange and red apps encrypt with static (fixed) keys that can be easily extracted by reverse-engineering the application and used to
decrypt stored data

#RSAC
Part II. Desirable security properties
 Entropy in random sources
 High entropy implies more unpredictability  Low entropy implies more predictability
We want a high degree of entropy (unpredictability) in the random numbers that are used for security-sensitive purposes like key generation. They should not follow any guessable pattern.
Overall goal: make it computationally infeasible to break the crypto

#RSAC
Part II. Android (Java) capabilities
Random number generation
java.security.SecureRandom(byte[] seed)
secureRandom.setSeed(byte[] seed)
The SecureRandom class defaults to seeding itself from /dev/urandom, but also lets the user intialize the generator with their own seed.
Problem: If a fixed value is used, it renders the output of the "random" generator completely predictable. We've seen cases where the value is a static constant of the program.
Solution: The default seed uses the Linux kernel's random number generator, which should suffice. Only seed the generator explicitly if you need and have a better entropy source than this.

#RSAC
Part II. Statistics
Low entropy in random number generation (for the 7% of apps that explicitly set random seeds)

108, 20%
436, 80%

Variable seed Static, fixed seed

Apps in red have low entropy since they seed the random generator with static strings defined in the application bytecode, resulting in completely predictable "random" numbers

K1000 is used as the final encryption key. The extra iterations slow down a password-guessing attack
(RFC 2898 recommends >=1000 iterations.)

Best Security Practices for SSL/Cryptography
SSL/TLS  Make sure that you are not bypassing important security features by using insecure TrustManagers or HostnameVerifiers in production code  Keep your libraries up to date
Cryptographic operations  Use algorithms that are stateful and have the indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack property  Pick keys, initial vectors, and salts using a source of random numbers with high entropy  Use at least 1000 iterations in computing keys to use with PasswordBased Encryption

#RSAC
Apply Slide
 Things to do soon:  Verify that your apps don't use unsafe HostnameVerifiers or TrustManagers. Doing so can defeat the protections provided by SSL.  Update your SSL implementations on app and server
 In the next few months  Consider how you store potentially sensitive user data on devices. Can you improve the handling of this data to improve user privacy?  Audit apps used by your organization for security vulnerabilities
 Long-term, consider  Features and design approaches for your apps to help user privacy and security
