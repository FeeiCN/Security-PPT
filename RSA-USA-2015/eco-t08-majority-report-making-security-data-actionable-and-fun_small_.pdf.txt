Why Visualize the Data?
Aren't pie charts enough?
What does advanced visualization give us?
Can't I just use R, Python, and/or Excel?

#RSAC
Learning Styles
 Neil Fleming's VAK/VARK model
 The 4 types
1. Visual learners 2. Auditory learners 3. Reading-writing preference learners 4. Kinesthetic learners or tactile learners

Learning Styles
 Key concept of visual learning
 Graphic organizers
 Visual representations of
 knowledge,  concepts,  thoughts, or  ideas

Learning Styles
 Clarify meaning through relationships
 Best example might be utilizing a mind map

#RSAC
Learning Styles
 Representing information spatially and with images [some*] students are able to
 focus on meaning  reorganize and group similar
ideas easily  make better use of their visual
memory

Graph Theory 101
Let G be a graph G = (V, E)
Where V = {0, 1, 2, 3}
And E = {(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 3)}

Why?
 Actors populate the knowledge graph
 Creation is understood, output is complex
 Layout closer to the "natural shape" of data structure
 Take advantage of the GPU to untangle information
 Humans are good at processing shapes and colors

Datasets!
#RSAC

#RSAC
Merger & Acquisition Dataset
 Looked at all merger and acquisition activity in the security space since 2002 (to the summer of 2014)
 Connected:
 Acquirers (who did the acquisition)  Targets (who was acquired)  Acquisition value (if disclosed)
 Data sourced from 451 Research's M&A Knowledgebase

#RSAC
Visualizing a Partner Network
 Graph of vendors and their partners
 Looking at a security partner ecosystem
 Who should your company partner with?

#RSAC 31

#RSAC
Visualizing a SHODAN Query
 https://www.shodan.io/  Lets you find specific computers (routers, servers, etc.) using a
variety of filters  Some have described it as a public port scan directory or a search
engine of banners

Email Graph
 Graph of email communications
 Indicative of distinct  Silos/divisions
 Different locations?  Many-to-one comms
 Email forwarding to team?

Dyre Botnet
 Typically distributed by the Cutwail botnet
 Via spam emails  With links to Dropbox or Cubby files
 Harvests credentials through traffic interception
 Primarily targets online banking websites for ACH/wire fraud
 When graphed, a we noticed the emergence of a unique shape

#RSAC
Exploring DGAs
 Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA)  Used to generate domains programmatically  Typically rely on a seed of some sort
 Date, time, keyword, etc.  Allows for the registration of domains that no human would ever type
 Not just used for malware
 Also used for marketing campaigns
