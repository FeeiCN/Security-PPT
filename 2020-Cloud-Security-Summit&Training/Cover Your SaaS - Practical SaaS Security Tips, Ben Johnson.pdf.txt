CLOUD IS ACCELERATING BUSINESS
SECURITY IMPERATIVE: ENABLE BUSINESS TO ADVANCE ITS
MISSION ... SAFELY! "75% OF THE CLOUD IS SAAS"
- DAVE SHACKLEFORD

AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE SAAS YET, IT'S COMING
Companies are picking a "cloud stack" of business services...the difference being these new technologies are cloud-based and designed for collaborEaMtAioILn.

CLOUDS TALK TO CLOUDS

WHO PROTECTS CLOUD? (HINT: YOU)

SAAS IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
The SaaS Provider handles all aspects except for identity and access management, client devices controls, and
data accountability.
The Customer (you), therefore, must understand users, devices & data related to that service.

CLOUD SECURITY NEEDS TO BE A PRIORITY

ALWAYS ON, ALWAYS REACHABLE TARGETS USERS OVERSHARE AND AUTHORIZE APPS LACK OF EXPERTISE IN CLOUD DETECTION
OVER-ACCESS INCREASES INSIDER RISK POORLY UNDERSTOOD, DISPARATE AUDIT LOGS

CLOUD SECURITY IS THE SAME ... AND DIFFERENT
 Enable the business to advance its mission ... SAFELY.
 Protect the business but also allow for the business -- productivity, cost savings, and innovation are largely why organizations are going to SaaS/PaaS/IaaS. If you (as security) hurt these, you will not be popular.
 Review and monitor access  Review and monitor privileges  Review and monitor configurations  Review and monitor behavior
So not that different from on-premise?
Yet the networks, assets, applications might not be under any of your control.

RESPOND DETECT PROTECT

WHAT'S SECURITY'S AIM FOR CLOUD?
 Protect account access  Enable responsible use  Enable responsible collaboration  Detect misuse, compromise, and other unwanted behavior  Investigate and cleanup when there's a problem
"The absence of disease does not mean health."

INTRO TO SAAS DETECTION
 Often, the primary goal for SaaS is to keep the adversaries out. This is a smart primary goal.
 Then you likely want to understand privileged activity, and any changes to privileged users.
 From here, understanding how your information might be exposed, such as sharing files broadly or buckets created.
 Then, observing any increases to the surface area by adding third party apps and/or new user accounts.
 Finally, insider threats, especially in IP-heavy companies and industries.

DETECTION: LOGINS (O365)

Timestamps, IP-addresses, user, results; some search capabilities

DETECTION: LOGINS (GSUITE)
Some useful information but lacking a lot of context

DETECTION: LOGINS (SALESFORCE)
Providing more context than some other systems

DETECTION: LOGINS SUMMARY
 What should you care about when it comes to logins?  Admin login times, locations  Unusual login locations across user population  Spikes in failed logins for a particular user  IP or Geo targeting many users (password sprays, credential stuffing, etc)

DETECTION: ACCESS / PRIVILEGE CHANGES (O365)

DETECTION: ACCESS / PRIVILEGE CHANGES (G SUITE)

DETECTION: ACCESS / PRIVILEGE SUMMARY
 What should you care about when it comes to access / privilege changes?  New privileges granted! (New admins, additional roles, etc)  Removal of privileged access (should be rare, want to scrutinize)  Specific grants, like Mailbox delegation  If possible, correlate new accounts to a source of truth (HR system)  Keep an eye on those contractors, consultants, and service providers

DETECTION: ADMIN ACTIVITY (GSUITE)

DETECTION: ADMIN ACTIVITY (DROPBOX, BOX)

DETECTION: BROADLY SHARED FILES (GSUITE)

DETECTION: OAUTH / THIRD-PARTY APPLICATIONS

DETECTION: SHARING SUMMARY
 What should you care about when it comes to sharing and third-party apps?  Sensitive scopes/grants (i.e. full GMail access)  Sharing externally with no expiration  Sharing externally with no password or restrictions  System-level apps that grant access to all accounts  Apps granted sensitive access that are only installed by 1 user (or a few users)

WHAT DOES OBSIDIAN DO (INTERNALLY)?
 SaaS and IaaS heavy  Worry about threats and excessive risk but try to always say YES to the business  Enable auditing on SaaS applications, pull telemetry into our own product connect up to
Splunk, Snowflake, Elasticsearch, datalake, etc.)  Enable cloudtrail, similar to SaaS ^^  IP-Geo enrichment (IPs often mean very little but countries or states DO mean something)  Send alerts to slack- GuardDuty, Marcie, Obsidian, Carbon Black, etc.  Operators see alerts in Slack and pivot to domain specific tools  We correlate either on Identity or IP  Operators don't need production access if the right data is flowing to the right place  Turn review tasks into alert tasks (get to good state and alert on drift/violation)!!!

PLAYBOOK
Some places for you to ...

MAKE ACCESS HAVE A HALF-LIFE
Stop thinking of accounts as binary.
When possible, set an end-date to FORCE review.
When not possible, force review through culture and process. "Use it or lose it."

LOCK DOWN WHAT YOU CAN
 Single Sign-On; create choke point  Create separate Admin accounts  Use built-in settings to disable forwarding, require
passwords on invites, allow maximum number of devices, conditional access, etc.  Watch out for Oauth, Linking Accounts, and API attacks

COLLECT TELEMETRY
 Activity drives access needs (and pruning)  Incident Response and compliance need
telemetry (enable audit logs!!!)  Lots of APIs out there ...
https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/ https://api.slack.com/ https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/ https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/api-explorer
 And so on... (and some tools -> )

MAKE IT EASY TO DO THE RIGHT THING
Make it easy to do the right thing: 1. Give users what they need (and sometimes want) 2. Have a (low-pain) process to approve new stuff
If you're a user/engineer/individual contributor, go through the proper channels: 1. Consider Security 2. Consider Privacy 3. Consider Productivity 4. Go through process from above!

MAKE IT INTEGRATED INTO THE BUSINESS
 Make them own it, with your reviews and oversight  Enable the teams that own various applications to integrate into your
authentication mechanisms  Provide guidance on privileged access and security controls  Monitor, pen-test, etc.
