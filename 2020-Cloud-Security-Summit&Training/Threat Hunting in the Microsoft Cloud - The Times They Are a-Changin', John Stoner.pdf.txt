In the next 30 minutes...
 Implications of moving to the cloud using Microsoft's cloud services, Azure Active Directory and Office 365 and the Attack surface
 Compare was is available in the cloud compared to on-premise and how the logging changes
 Perform an abbreviated hunt in Azure AD and Office 365 to observe the fidelity of the events that a hunter would have access to
 Illustrate why cloud logging needs to be supplemented with on-premise logs

A Very High-Level View of Microsoft Cloud Services

Microsoft Cloud is a high value target

Phishing Password Spray

"attackers have started to spoof the new Azure AD sign-in page in multiple phishing campaigns. We have so far seen several dozens of phishing sites used in these campaigns" - Microsoft Security Intelligence 2020
"80% of those compromised enterprise accounts,... almost 1 million hacked accounts in January alone, were hit by either "password spray" or "replay" attacks." - Forbes, March 2020

Malware

"As Office 365 OAuth apps can give attackers complete access to an Office 365 account, they can be used for a variety of attacks." - bleepingcomputer.com, Dec 2019

Once in, they are in
Office 365 and Azure security is great unless adversary gets legitimate credentials
Logging can be challenging
Microsoft's cloud logging can be difficult to configure and it has some interesting event time to index time issues
Adversaries are targeting it, but we aren't looking
It's another place to hunt, with new detections to build

Password Spraying

Brute Force Password Attack

Keep hitting the same user account with a dictionary of passwords and permutations until you get a hit Thresholds in the authentication system trigger lock outs SIEMs have rules to detect this

Words of Caution
Over time, clouds change shape
 The exact fields or detail may change over time at the discretion of the cloud provider
 When you set this up, you may find more data or less available to you
 Important to understand the differences compared to on-premise Windows logging

Key Fields of Note

Message Trace in MS Cloud

Initial intelligence around Taedonggang indicates that they may use link files to gain access to
a targeted environment

.LNK Visibility?
 What is the name of the link file that was associated with anonymous clicks?
 Which users are associated with that link file?  Who was the first named user to click the link?  What workload is the anonymous file access
associated with?

Suspicious Link File
 What was the first operation seen?

Anonymous Link Creation

Anonymous Link Creation

Tell Us More About Bruce...

Different Users, Same IP

Azure Active Directory and Fyodor

What Accounts Are Being Modified?

Properties Being Changed?

Exchange Visibility

Things We Can't See

Workstations Logs Servers not in Azure Network/Wire Data

What We Learned From Our Hunt

 Bruce Gist's account was compromised  Created an anonymous link that was used to gain additional access to Frothly
 Fyodor's account was compromised  Fyodor had elevated privileges  This account was used to enable a dormant user and assign elevated creds to maintain persistence  This account also modified Exchange permissions and rules to gain access to emails
 Files were moved around and out of Frothly

What Can We Operationalize?

Logins of different users from the same IP?
Tenant/Site Admin modifications?

Exchange Rule Creations?

File Upload/Download?

Tough by itself, perhaps with additional criteria based on behavior

ATT&CK for Microsoft Cloud Services
Azure, Azure Active Directory and Office365

What Techniques Did We Observe the
Adversary Using?
Azure, Azure Active Directory and Office365

Summary
 Understand the difference between the logging MS Cloud provides compared to Microsoft logs on premise
 Much of it is easy to understand
 BUT...it is cloaked in JSON
 Use who, what, where, when, why and how to form the basis of your hunt
 Schemas and fields may change over time
