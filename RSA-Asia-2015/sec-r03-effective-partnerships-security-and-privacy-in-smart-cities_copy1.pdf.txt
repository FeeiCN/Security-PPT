#RSAC
Security/Privacy Concerns are Significant*

 Many firms selling "smart systems" fail to build in effective security.

 City authorities often fail to test systems they buy

 The attack surface is huge and complex

 Lack of oversight and insufficient budgets

 How do you determine how much security and privacy are needed?

 Examples:
 200,000 traffic control sensors are vulnerable to attack (IOActive)
 Smartphone sensors can reveal highly personal data including gender, age, psychological state, and movement patterns (FTC)
