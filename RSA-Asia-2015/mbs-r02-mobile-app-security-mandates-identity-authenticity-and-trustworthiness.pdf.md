Session Objectives
 Introduce the mobile threat domain  Discuss traditional internet solution components  Explain the three focus domains for delivering a secure mobile app
 Identification of the user  Trustworthiness of the device  Authenticity of the app code  Live demonstration of integrated solutions for the focus domains  Actions for takeaway for your business

#RSAC
Breadth of Mobile Security Domains
Focus of the session today at this end

Enterprise Applications and Cloud Services

Device Security

Content Security

Identity, Fraud, and Data Protection

Application Security

Transaction Security

#RSAC
Introducing New Mobile Threats

Mobile Banking Fraud Vectors

#RSAC

Compromised and Vulnerable Devices

Account

Cross-Channel Credential

Takeover via a Mobile Device

Theft

Jailbroken/rooted devices susceptible to
suspicious apps, malware

Web-based device ID isn't effective on a mobile device

Malware and Phishing credential theft from the
desktop enable mobile fraud

Mobile Malware and Suspicious Apps

#RSAC

 SMS Interceptors (only when relevant)  Device rooters  Data stealers  Generic downloaders  Key-loggers

 Android risk is higher due to multiple, not Google-controlled, marketplaces

#RSAC
Mobile App Code is Vulnerable to Attacks

Integrity Risk
(Code Modification or Code Injection Vulnerabilities)

 Application binaries can be modified
 Run-time behavior of applications can be altered
 Malicious code can be injected or hooked into applications

Confidentiality Risk
(Reverse Engineering or Code Analysis Vulnerabilities)

 Sensitive information can be exposed
 Applications can be reverse-engineered back to the source code
 Code can be lifted and reused or repackaged

#RSAC
Traditional Solutions are Adapting to APIs

Business Services Service Oriented Architecture
WS-Security

Access Management Authentication Authorization Entitlements

B2B SOA

(Web API

Services)

IBM DataPower Gateway

Native Mobile

Hybrid Mobile

Web 2.0 (AJAX)

Mobile Web

Web Browsers and Portals

 AJAX has emerged to address (1) complexity of SOA implementations; and (2) corruption of browser HTTP/HTML

Broad Range of Security Expectations

#RSAC

1. Web Application Firewall 2. XML Schema Validation and Scoped Access Control 3. Context Based Authorization and Authentication 4. Device based Threat Detection

#RSAC
Global Collaboration is Required
 Global network to provide intelligence to respond to Present Threats

#RSAC
Deployable to Cloud Infrastructure
 Continuous deployment

Secure usage of SaaS
Apps, APIs Services Bluemix
Secure usage of PaaS

 Elastically scalable  Turn-key solutions  Low Maintenance cost

Securing workloads on IaaS

 API and Mobile ready

#RSAC
Mobile: Realization of Strategy
Identity the user on their device Check Platform Trustworthiness Ensure App is Legitimate

#RSAC
Identity the user on their device
 Adopt Multi-factor authentication solutions
 E.g. U/P Conversion to token/PIN number, Integrated One-Time-Password flow
 Ensure Device is bound to authenticating User at run-time  Authorization considers combination of App, Device and User

Demonstration: Native App Banking Use Case with Malware

#RSAC
Demonstration Use Cases
 Android Native Mobile App that demonstrates the end to end security requirements
 User registration and two factor authentication
 username/password = Token+PIN
 Server side policy based authorization
 Leveraging Access features to support Native API integration  Device fingerprinting  API integrated to ensure App authenticity verification
 Preventing Fraud by using policy based detection of Mobile Malware present on the device

#RSAC
Cloud Deployed Demonstration Environment
 Deployed within IBM Softlayer as a set of virtual appliances

Call to Action
 Does your Security technology and processes contain such controls...  Are you relying on technology that doesn't integrate...  Are your competitor Apps out competing yours...
 Through non functional aspects such as speed to market, performance
 Do you have a reliable vendor that relies on global intelligence data to make meaningful threat decisions...
 Are your API teams talking to your Security teams...
