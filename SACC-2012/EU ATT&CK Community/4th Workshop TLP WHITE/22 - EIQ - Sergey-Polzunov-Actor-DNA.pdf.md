Generating MITRE ATT&CK DNA for groups of actors
Sergey Polzunov, EclecticIQ

Hypotheses
 There are differences in styles of operation on a threat actor / intrusion set level
 These differences can be detected when we compare ATT&CK techniques observed in campaigns
 Subtle differences on a threat actor level become more pronounced when actors are grouped together (by nation state, for example)

Algorithm
 Requirements:
 Data with connected STIX entities, CTI data model on top of STIX and taxonomies (MITRE ATT&CK, etc)
 Define seed entities:
 specific threat actors, grouped in datasets (nation states)
 Generate contexts:
 Walk the graph from the seeds, identify relevant entities, filter out irrelevant ones, count taxonomy nodes seen in entities
 Calculate TF-IDFS for ATT&CK techniques seen in the contexts  Merge most interesting techniques per actor into a group's techniques set

 Most popular (for the actor) exotic (across all) techniques used

TF (term) = Term Frequency (term) = # "# $%&'( $')& *++'*)( %, $-' ."/
$"$*0 # "# $')&( %, $-' ."/

IDF (term) = Inverse Document Frequency (term) =

(

$"$*0 # "# ."/

)

# "# ."/( /",$*%,%,5 $')&

TF-IDF (term) = TF (term) * IDF (term)

Disclaimer
 The data has noise in it:
 Old techniques use same numeric IDs as new ones  Mistyped ATT&CK IDs  Incorrectly tagged entities  Incorrect relations between entities
 The results here are only from the data we have in our DB  The methodology and our data is surely full of biases
