An update (*)
<snap> We are planning on merging PRE-ATT&CK into Enterprise ATT&CK. If you take a look at the PRE-ATT&CK matrix, we're planning on deprecating what's currently covered by the first three PRE-ATT&CK tactics, and folding the rest into new tactics in Enterprise ATT&CK. Our goal is to still represent all of the real-world, technical activity that's covered by the other 12 Tactics, but inside of ATT&CK. I'll be previewing what that looks like at ATT&CKcon (**) next week (and that should be streamed live). That said, I wouldn't expect any visible changes to PRE-ATT&CK until early next year as it's dependent on our release of sub-techniques, and I would expect the current version to remain published (but deprecated) even after that happens. </snap>
