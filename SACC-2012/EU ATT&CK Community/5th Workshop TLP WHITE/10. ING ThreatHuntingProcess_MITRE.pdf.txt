Threat Hunting Process
 Hunts are investigative efforts that yield high fidelity insights  Aim to detect what conventional monitoring appliances won't capture

 Hunt Creation  Create a Hunt Playbook  Register Hunt on Kanban
 Hunt query automation  Alert & Testing  Data enrichment
 Data onboarding  Onboarding process  Request for new sources

Hunt development

! Hunting capabilities are highly depended on existing data sources ! Querying environment and specific tool set for exploratory analysis

Development
Datasource Availability
Query search
Further research

Kanban phases

Testing
Experimentation phase

Acceptance
Running for 1-2 weeks

False positive ratio Early detections
Refinement and QA

Assigned to Testing

Escalated as normal incidents

Deprecated
Previous hunts
Out of scope
No more datasources
Incorporated by another hunt
Picked up by Monitoring Appliaces
