#WeFightBullies

 We defend teams and organisations that feel overwhelmed by the increasing risk of cyber security breaches and attacks

Methodology
Identify relevant Threat Actors

Determine their TTPs

Map Current Capability

Create a heatmap of confirmed IOCs
vs blind spots

Determine telemetry requirements and controls
#WeFightBullies

Drive risk-based investments

List of signals & telemetry

So now we have...
1. A list of relevant actors 2. A list of relevant TTPs 3. Positive coverage (list of things we know we can find) 4. Known blind spots (list of things we know we can't find) 5. A list of controls to mitigate those blind spots (investment needs) 6. How do we drive investment?

SOC Framework

7 Threat actors

50 TTPs, 150 IOCs

45 IOCs - confirmed

105 IOCs - blind

#WeFightBullies

7 Controls (750K CAPEX) 4 Controls (350K OPEX)

Risk Coverage 30%
Residual risk 70%

1) Threat-focused SOC (not volume)
 Your threats should determine the signals and telemetry you need (not the other way around!)

2) Investment Performance
 Measuring risk coverage and investment performance is essential to communicating the Business Value of the SOC

3) Continuous Improvement

 A SOC is a living, breathing organism: ATT&CK Threat Modelling is the key for continuous improvement!
