MISP and ATT&CK - a love story
The MISP threat sharing platform is a free and open source software enabling information sharing, collaboration, automation and modeling of a wide gamut of intelligence.

Generalised contextualisation model
 MISP already had a system in place allowing users to contextualise data using a shared library of knowledge base elements called galaxies.
 The initial implementation (in August 2017) of ATT&CK was a regular galaxy.
 Users could already share and filter by techniques and tactics out-of-the-box using ATT&CK.

Improved UI mimicing ATT&CK navigator
 After the first ATT&CK community workshop in Luxembourg (24-25 May 2018), the release and presentation of navigator opened up our eyes.
 Users got to use a familar UI, representing the kill-chain elements in a meaningful way.

Community extension for ATT&CK-like galaxies
 Seeing an interest into modeling other concerns similarly to the ATT&CK model, MISP added an option to create your own ATT&CK-like matrices.

Future
 We saw an increase of ATT&CK contextualisation in different information sharing communities relying on MISP.
 Sighting and the sharing of metrics among information sharing communities is becoming a requirement.
 Introducing CAR in MISP is the logical next step pending the evolution of CAR.
