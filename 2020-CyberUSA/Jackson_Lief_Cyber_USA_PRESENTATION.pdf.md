Key Questions and Topics
We will come to the board with key questions we are trying to answer and seek advice. We move fast so often one quarter is a year for us in normal time so we know the following is our most pressing need right now: We are looking for answers for our sales development side of the business:
 What problems do enterprises have that we can solve now?  Are there other trending problems in the market that we can solve?  How should we go about the process of sales to enterprises?  How do we expand to new areas across technology?  Who has been successful at selling you and why? Who hasn't been successful and why?

Next steps
We want each of you to advise us on the messaging and packaging to small, medium, large, and enterprise for the below teams: -Cyber security- SOC team -CISO-Executive Management level -IT- IT manager -Executives- Board Level Next steps: Set up of on-going meetings Cadance and structure of the meetings Any Questions?

Learning Experience- Current and Roadmap

Current - On-Demand Courses - Multiple Choice Assessments - Guided Labs - Sandbox Labs - Capture the flags - Practice Tests - Webinars - Supplementals- Flashcards, glossaries, etc - Case Studies - Podcasts - Blogs

In-Progress - Coding labs - Programming - Live training - Hands-on Assessments - Knowledge Checks - Community discussion*
Heard about - Gaming content and competition - Cyber Ranges - Placement Exams - Project based learning

Cybrary 2020 Catalog Expectations- Roadmap
Continued Workrole Curricula: Cyber Jobs and Cyber Enabled Data Science [Machine Learning/AI]- Add a partner build out the content DevSecOps [Secure Coding]- Add a partner Leadership/General Management

Levers to think about in the product
 Are we selecting the right content?- Overview of the process . Building it in the right way?Modalities for learning
 Are we delivering/distributing the learning in the best way possible to the learner?- career paths and growth
 Are following the content selection process that we want?  Free vs Paid content- What should be free and what should be paid  Build, buy, partner for the content- We build the video based learning and partner for hands-
on content, this can change  Opportunities: Instructional Consulting- Largest Contract is this a market to tap- How we
should be partnering with companies for content and content development.  Critical partnership we should be developing for taxonomy- Burning Glass

NICE/NIST Alignment
All content hours in the catalog have been tagged down to the NICE/NIST competency level. Most content hours have been tagged down to the KSA(Knowledge, Skills, Abilities) level.
What does this mean?
 Training coverage for all work roles established within the NICE Cybersecurity Framework  Custom curriculums matching the NICE/NIST competency levels and KSAs can be created  18 NICE/NIST curriculums developed  We have found that this is good for government entities and want to lean into a
consolidated framework for private enterprises.

Powering our platform via a community of content creators
 Over the next year, we'll be growing our creator network to more than 300 active creators per month.
 Clear, concise expectations  Effective creator onboarding  Ongoing coaching and rubric-based evaluation

Phase I | Strategic Roadmapping
Learning Science Data Set Analysis [Course Performance, User Interviews, Trends in the Space] By analyzing multiple datasets in conjunction with modern learning science, we curate our: Creator Tools (Outlines, Guides, Rubrics) Content Roadmap (Skills, Topics, Certifications, Modalities, Vendors, etc) Learning Experience (Assessments, Course Structure, etc)
For Internal Use Only

Course Creation Outlines, Rubrics, Examples

Roadmapping

Phase II | Recruitment
Once we have our roadmap established, we can start sourcing instructors.
Retroactive Creator Recruiting- Apply through the site Proactive Creator Recruiting- Finding a part of content roadmap that needs to be filled
Once they pass the initial screening, we move forward with the audition process, where they produce a sample of the course they would teach.
After producing their audition, they generally submit a second audition after feedback. This shows they are coachable. We then start coaching these SMEs into instructors.
For Internal Use Only

Audition Phase

Phase III | Creation
Creators then move on to the creation phase, where they receive a contract to produce a course/series in a given time frame.
They are provided additional resources like professional equipment, teaching assistants to help them produce the course, additional coaching, and an invitation to our creator community.
Our creator community is where all of our creation takes place. Everything from resource creation to project management happens there.
For Internal Use Only

COURSE CREATION

Phase IV | Review
Everything produced by a creator undergoes careful review, where SMEs/instructors/and teaching assistants review the materials for accuracy, quality, and engagement. If any adjustments need to be made, additional resources, coaching, and handheld guidance are provided to ensure quality + timeline.
For Internal Use Only

Phase V | "Completion"
By the time a course is "completed" all of the videos are completed/reviewed and they are usually accompanied by community sourced resources like quizzes, study guides, etc. to create a robust overall course. "Completion" is in quotations because a course is never truly completed. There is always room for improvement, updates, and further resources to be provided for the course. Our instructors are constantly improving and creating new content. The team monitors feedback and growth of the course. One month after release we review the metrics and feedback with the instructor. If there are changes to be made the instructor will often complete these changes and we will re-release the course with the updates/additions.
For Internal Use Only

Completed Course

Assessment of Vendor Products
 To help meet our content goals, we implemented the Vendor Content Rubric, a 27-point review of every product used on our platform.
 Graded across:
 Content Development (# of courses served/supported, learning modalities, etc)
 Platform Development (Customization, Roadmap, Update speed, etc)  User Experience (Uptime, ease of use, etc)  Support (helpdesk, support schedules, etc)  Cost  Reporting (Scoring, time to completion, proctoring data, etc)

Course Creation Rubrics

Our community Process
 We are the instructor developer platform. Competitors only look for highly qualified instructors to instruct on their platform.
 Our application is a lot more open and allows for multiple attempts to pass through the process.
 7% of applicants pass through the process and become instructors on our site.
 Feedback from the community + us throughout your journey
