Introduction
 Martin van Hensbergen - Fox-IT  Studied Mathematics at University of Delft  Worked at Fox-IT 2001-2011 + 2016-?  Mostly as developer but also in few other areas
 2007-2011, worked on FoxReplay  Software for full-content reconstruction of network data  Lawful interception & forensics purposes  Required network protocol knowledge

Bro at Fox-IT - Passive Audit
 We take a `photograph' of the network by passively monitoring 4 weeks of network traffic
 Combination of:  Bro  Suricata  Custom tooling

Bro at Fox-IT - Passive Audit
 Bro gives us a very detailed run-down on:  Protocols used in a network  Flow data
 Suricata gives us alerting on known-bad

Use strengths of multiple products

Suricata

Wireshark

Bro at Fox-IT - Passive Audit
 Mix: Automated and manual analysis  Deliver report on security of the network

Bro at Fox-IT - Passive Audit
 Some things we look for:  Weak protocols (security wise) / SSL configs / Plaintext passwords  `Weird' traffic / Context surrounding alerts  Network segmentation  Services exposed to e.g. outside world  Remote administration tools  RDP ... why not RFB/VNC?

VNC basics
 Versatile protocol to view and control GUI's over a network connection.
 Original spec (v3.3) by Olivetti Research Lab in 1998, later maintained by RealVNC: v3.7 in 2003 and v3.8 in 2007.
 Protocol published under RFC6143 by RealVNC in 2011

VNC basics
 Server runs RFB server ( e.g. RealVNC server ); listens on (default) TCP port 5900  RFB client connects over network  Client can control server over network

The dangers of VNC

The dangers of VNC
 My colleague Yonathan Klijnsma did some research on publicly reachable VNC servers
 It's 2016 .... VNC IS EVERYWHERE!

The dangers of VNC

The dangers of VNC

Dangers of VNC
 All good and fun until...

The dangers of VNC - IoT

Dangers of VNC
 All good and fun untill:

Dangers of VNC
 VNC connections open to:  Medical devices  SCADA systems  Factories  Homes

Dangers of VNC
 VNC:  no- or weak authentications  unencrypted

Bro Wishlist
 What would we want to see from a security perspective:  are there RFB servers in the network?  from where and when are they accessed, for how long?  which software is used?  what kind of authentication is used, was it successful?  other useful information?
 Bonus exercise: can we get a screenshot?

VNC protocol security
 Server sends a list of supported `security types'  These determine form of authentication
(examples):  1 = No authentication  2 = VNC authentication  30 = Apple Remote Desktop authentication

VNC protocol - VNC authentication

16 byte challenge

Client
16 byte response

Server

DES(challenge) with password derived key

VNC protocol - VNC authentication
 Custom authentication types possible  Found VNC server implementation that does
send username/password in cleartext over wire

VNC protocol - Security result
 Server always sends an explicit acknowledgment if authentication succeeded.
 If not successful: connection aborted

VNC protocol - Init messages
 Client sends ClientInit message with a `shared_flag'
 Shared flag determines mode of operation:
 1 = Allow other connections to remain if present
 0 = Disconnect other connections for exclusive access

VNC protocol - Init messages
 Server sends ServerInitMsg, containing:  name of the server  width/height of shared screen in pixels  16 bytes of pixel information encoding information

VNC protocol - frame messages
 After the initial handshake, the server sends a complete representation of the server's screen to the client
 One should be able to reconstruct a complete screenshot from the screen using this first message!

 Complete screen update first!
 Then: Client and Server can send messages at will:
 containing keystrokes, mouse pointer movements, screen updates.
 For our purpose too much effort at this stage

Dev/test/deploy
 Ingredients for creating a protocol parser:  wireshark and loads of sample PCAPs  knowledge of BinPac and Bro policy writing  knowledge of the protocol (obviously)

Dev

BinPac (protocol parsing) Scripts

 Define events to emit
 Define protocol messages
 BinPac creates C++ parser
Define DPD to identify streams to process Connect events from parser to log output

Testing

Create tests based on pcaps
Supply suspected output of your parser

Dev - where to start
 documentation on-line  learn from existing protocol parsers  https://github.com/grigorescu/binpac_quickstart
 creates some boilerplate code for you to get your parser up and running
 bro-dev mailinglist  great supportive community!

Dev - be prepared
 #1 - No matter how simple the protocol, there's always a catch
 #2 - No matter how well your protocol parser is, someone will always present you with a pcap that doesn't parse

 Ideally, we would like to have something like this:
Each message self-descriptive (SMB!)

 RFB messages do not contain e.g. a command identifier, or total size of the message
 How to interpret a set of bytes depends on the messages before it
 rfb-protocol-analyzer.pac implements state machine

State machine BinPac
`state' - defines step in our protocol.
After successfully
parsing a message, `state' gets
updated accordingly.

 E.g. custom authentication protocols

$ bro-cut id.resp_h desktop_name name width height share_flag < rfb.log 192.168.2.125 root's X desktop (martin-VirtualBox:1) 1024 768 T 192.168.2.125 - - - 192.168.2.125 - - - -

Recap
 We have seen why it is interesting to parse RFB
 We have seen how RFB works and what information we can get from parsing the protocol
 We have seen what steps to take to build and test a protocol parser
 We have seen how we can answer our research questions

Recap
 First version of RFB parser commit:
 Will be in 2.5 release

Future work
 Handle different dialects/authentication types/ implementations (pcaps welcome!)
