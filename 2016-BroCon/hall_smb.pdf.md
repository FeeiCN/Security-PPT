SMB Analyzer (Server Message Block)
Seth Hall ICSI/Broala/LBNL

It was only SMB1 and architected in a hybrid Binpac/C++ style.

How many versions?!
Fortunately everything after
2.0 is small revisions on the
same thing!
Wikipedia forgot about the SMB 1.0
protocol?!

Logs!
 smb_mapping.log
 When a client maps a drive share, that mapping is documented here.
 smb_files.log
 When an action on file is seen on a share, it's presence is documented along with timestamps. The user can customize what actions to log. This is where things like renames and deletes will go (SMB2 only for now!). Files that are actually transferred will be logged in files.log
 dce_rpc.log
 Remote procedure calls. Watch for remote admin!
 ntlm.log
 Authentication using NTLM. This is only integrated into the SMB analyzer right now, but later will be integrated in other places.

More ideas
 Search for: "finance", "tax", "accounting", "backup", "audit", "hr", "merger", "acquisition"  Look for servers and clients using and looking at those files.  Create HoneyPot directories that would match those and watch for access to them.
 Analyze GPO policies (they're just files!)  Bitlocker recovery keys being stored as PDFs.  Ransomware detection!  File hash detection with Intel framework already works.

Using it today
 If you want to use it today, install git master, the 2.5 Beta, or the 2.5 release when it's available.
 Add "@load protocols/smb" to local.bro  We decided to leave it disabled by default in 2.5 because it's a lot of
new code and everyone may not be ready for it.
