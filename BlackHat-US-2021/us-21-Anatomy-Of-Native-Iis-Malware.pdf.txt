Architecture

Internet Information Services (IIS)
 Microsoft web server software  Modular architecture (since v7.0)  IIS services configured to run at each system start (World Wide
Web Publishing Service, Windows Process Activation Service or Application Host Helper Services)  IIS Worker Process (w3wp.exe)
 Handles inbound requests  Loads all IIS modules configured in
%windir%\system32\inetsrv\config\ApplicationHost.config

Understanding the TTPs

1 IIS backdoors
execute backdoor commands on IIS server
Special HTTP request with backdoor commands
1 2
Command output

Backdoor commands
 Get system information  Upload/download files  Execute files or shell commands  Create reverse shell  Create/list/move/rename/delete files and folders  Map local drives to remote drives  Exfiltrate collected data
Attacker HTTP requests
 A custom HTTP header present  An embedded password in the URL, request body,
headers (hardcoded password or password hash in the malware)  A specific format of URL or request body  A more complex condition #BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

Attacker HTTP request example
See Group 7 in the paper

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

2 IIS infostealers
intercept traffic and steal data from legitimate visitors

See Group 5 in the paper

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

DEMO

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

3 IIS injectors
serve malicious content to legitimate visitors

See Group 12 in the paper
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

4 IIS proxies
relay traffic between a compromised host and the C&C server

See Group 9 in the paper

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

5 SEO fraud
deceive search engine crawlers

See Group 13 in the paper

 Manipulates content served to search engine crawlers to boost SEO for selected websites

 Legitimate user requests are ignored by the malware

 Techniques used:

 Keyword stuffing

 Injecting a list of backlinks

 Redirecting the crawlers (turning the compromised website into a doorway page)

 This is not Black Hat SEO

 A third-party website benefits from the manipulation, not the one serving the manipulated content (this is likely sold as a service)

 C&C communication to obtain configuration data

 Other malicious modes present (e.g. backdoor, proxy)

Detection, mitigation and remediation

Detecting compromised servers

Inspect installed modules

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

Detecting compromised servers

Check IIS logs
the default location is %SystemDrive%\inetpub
\logs\LogFiles

Inspect installed modules
via IIS Manager, AppCmd.exe or inspect the configuration file %windir%\system32\inetsrv\
config\ApplicationHost.config

Scan for known malware families
use IoCs and YARA rules listed on our GitHub repository

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

DEMO

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

Mitigation (of compromise vectors)

Prevent server exploitation
 keep your OS up-to-date  limit services exposed to the internet
 use strong passwords and 2FA for dedicated administrative accounts

Prevent installing malicious (e.g.,
trojanized) modules
 only install modules from trusted sources
 consider using an endpoint security solution
