Timing attacks...

if secret condition: do_something()
# continue

for el in arr: if check_secret_property(el): break

if len(arr_with_secret_elements) > 0: do_something()

Remote Timing Attacks
 Step 1: attacker connects to target server
  Step 2: attacker sends a (large) number of requests to the server
  Step 3: for each request attacker measures time it takes to receive a response
  Step 4: attacker compares timing of 2 sets of requests (baseline vs target)
  Step 5: using statistical analysis, it is determined which request took longer
  Step 6: SUCCESS?

Remote Timing Attacks Success
 Performance of timing attacks is influenced by different aspects:
  Network connection between attacker and server
  higher jitter  worse performance
  attacker could try to move closer to target, e.g. same cloud provider
  Jitter is present on both upstream and downstream path
  Size of timing leak determines if attack can be successful
  Timing difference of 50ms is easier to detect than 5탎
  Number of measurements (more  better performance)

Timeless Timing Attacks

Timeless Timing Attacks
 Absolute response timing is unreliable, as it will always include
jitter for every request

 Let's get rid of the notion of time (hence timeless)
  Instead of relying on sequential timing measurements, 
we can exploit concurrency and only consider response order => no absolute timing measurements!!

 Timeless timing attacks are unaffected by network jitter

Timeless Timing Attacks: Requirements
1. Requests need to arrive at the same time at the server
 2. Server needs to process requests concurrently 3. Response order needs to reflect difference in execution time

Requirement #1: simultaneous arrival
 Two options: multiplexing or encapsulation
  Multiplexing:

 Needs to be supported by the protocol (e.g. HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 enable
multiplexing, HTTP/1.1 does not)

 A single packet can carry multiple requests that will be processed
concurrently

 Encapsulation:  Another network protocol is responsible for encapsulating multiple streams
(e.g. HTTP/1.1 over Tor or VPN)

HTTP/2 (multiplexing)

HEADERS GET /a

HEADERS GET /b

1 TCP packet

HTTP/1.1 + Tor (encapsulation)

GET /a

GET /b

TCP src: 45212

TCP src: 45214

Tor cell 1

Tor cell 2

1 TCP packet

Requirement #2: concurrent execution
 Application-dependent; most can be executed in parallel
possible exception: crypto operations that rely on sequential operations
Requirement #3: response order
 Most operations will generate response immediately after processing
  On TLS connections, response is decrypted in same order as it was
encrypted on the server. TCP sequence numbers or (relative) TCP timestamps can also be used

How many requests/pairs are needed?

Attack Scenarios

1. direct timing attack

2. cross-site timing attack

3. Wi-Fi authentication

Cross-site Timing Attack
 Victim user lands on malicious website (by clicking a link, malicious
advertisement, urgent need to look at cute animal videos, ...)

 Attacker launches attack from JavaScript to trigger requests to targeted web
server

 Victim's cookies are automatically included in request; request is processed
using victim's authentication

 Attacker observes response order (e.g. via fetch.then()), and leaks
sensitive information that victim shared with website

 Real-world example: abuse search function on HackerOne to leak information
about private reports

Cross-site Timeless Timing Attack
 Attacker has no low-level control over network; browser chooses how to send
request to kernel

 Need another technique to force 2 requests in single packet
  TCP congestion control to the rescue!!
  Congestion control prevents client from sending all packets at once
needs ACK from server before sending more

 When following requests are queued, they are merged in single packet !

fetch(target_bogus_url, { "mode": "no-cors", "credentials": "include", "method": "POST", "body": veryLongString
});
fetch(target_baseline_url, { "mode": "no-cors", "credentials": "include"
});
fetch(target_alt_url, { "mode": "no-cors", "credentials": "include"
});

Attack Scenarios

1. direct timing attack

2. cross-site timing attack

3. Wi-Fi authentication

Exploiting Wi-Fi authentication (WPA2 w/ EAP-pwd)

WPA2 & EAP-pwd
 WPA2 is one of the most widely used Wi-Fi protocols
  Authentication can be done using certificates (e.g. EAP-PEAP), or using passwords,
relying on EAP-pwd

 Authentication happens between client and authentication server 
(e.g. FreeRADIUS), access point forwards messages

 Communication between AP and authentication server is typically protected using TLS
  EAP-pwd uses hash-to-curve to verify password

 A timing leak was found! "
  "Fortunately" small timing difference, so considered not possible to exploit #

Bruteforcing Wi-Fi passwords
 Timing side-channel in hash-to-curve method is exploited
  Response order is enough information to perform bruteforce attack
  Probability of incorrect order only 0.38%
  Example RockYou password dump

 14M passwords
  40 measurements needed
  ~86% success probability
  Costs less than $1 to bruteforce password on cloud

1. direct timing attack

Overview
2. cross-site timing attack

3. Wi-Fi authentication

DEMO

$documents = textSearch($query);
if (count($documents) > 0) { $securityLevel = getSecurityLevel($user);
// filter documents based on security level... }

attack.py
url_prefix = 'https://vault.drud.us/search.php?q=BLACKHAT_PASSWORD=' r1 = H2Request('GET', url_prefix + char) # @ is not part of the charset so serves as baseline r2 = H2Request('GET', url_prefix + `@')
async with H2Time(r1, r2, num_request_pairs=15) as h2t: results = await h2t.run_attack() num_negative = len([x for x in results if x < 0]) pct_reverse_order = num_negative / len(results)
if pct_reverse_order > threshold: print('Found next character: %s' % char)

Conclusion
 Timeless timing attacks are not affected by network jitter at all
  Perform remote timing attacks with an accuracy similar to an attack against
the local system

 Attacks can be launched against protocols that feature multiplexing
or by leveraging a transport protocol that enables encapsulation
 All protocols that meet the criteria can be susceptible to timeless
timing attacks: we created practical attacks against HTTP/2 and EAP-pwd (Wi-Fi)
