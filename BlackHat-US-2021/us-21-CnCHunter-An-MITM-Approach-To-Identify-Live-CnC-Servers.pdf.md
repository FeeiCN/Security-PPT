CnCs are the Achilles Heel of IoT botnets

 Understanding Command and Control (CnC) Servers help:  Detecting, monitoring, mitigating (e.g blacklisting), subverting
 IoT devices have limited computing resource and hence:  Defense at the network perimeter

Communication protocol barely changes within a family
 We used a generic IRC server to imitate Gafgyt malware CnC

 Gafgyt family protocol
- Text based - Similar to IRC
99.5% of our Gafgyt samples successfully
communicated!

Only 1 gafgyt sample is enough to search for CnCs of the entire family!

CnC servers are short lived

 We manually analyzed 100 IoT malware and found their CnC server

 Roughly, only half of the CnCs of the samples are live by the day they are submitted

Related work is mainly focused on actively probing the Internet in search of CnC servers

Mirai Malware
 First appeared in August 2016  Responsible for disrupting several high-profile websites:
including Github, Twitter, Reddit, Netflix, Airbnb
 Still very active!

Active Probing for Mirai
 After a successful infection, the bot starts communicating with its CnC

echo "$CnC_DNS_ADDR $CANDIDATE_IP" >> /etc/hosts
How can we support DNS based CnC addresses?
- Manipulate local DNS resolution - Resolve CnC DNS address to the candidate address

What traffic should be redirected?
Only the traffic to the CnC
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

Finding CnC Traffic

Finding which traffic is to the CnC is non trivial!

Other Traffic:

1. Communication with CnC is usually over TCP

1. Proliferation (Scanning) 2. Background

2. Sinkholed and backlisted CnC DNS addresses would not resolve3. Random

3. CnC IP address is frequently contacted

 Live servers => Many tcp packets with ACK

 Dead servers => Many tcp packets with SYN/RST

4. CnC port is usually unique

5. CnC servers do not have very good reputation

Which candidate address is a CnC?

CnC Hunter

? Candidate address 1 ? ? Candidate address 2

Candidate address 3 .... Whoever is live, listens to our target port and is not filtered will respond!
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
26

Evaluating candidates' responses
 Live => there is a response  Listens => successful TCP handshake  Not filtered => no RST flag

Are these enough?

Which candidate address is a CnC?

156.8.10.2:443

CnC Hunter

14.11.3.24:443 X

211.210.31.15 X
The second address listens and responds to requests on port 443 but is not CnC
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
28

Which port listener is a CnC?
 We observed that CnCs respond with Significantly lower number of SYN flag  We use simple SYN frequency outlier detection based on standard deviation
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
29

CnC Hunter is accurate!
 We evaluated CnC finding functionality of CnC Hunter  Dataset: A set of 100 samples collected between 2016 to 2021
 Mirai, Gafgyt, Tsunami, Remaiten, LightAidra and VPNFilter  Could activate 90% of samples

Precision of CnC finding: Exclusively found by

92%

CnC Hunter: 18%

Demo
 Demo 1: Given an unknown IoT malware binary, find its CnC server
- Malware: Mirai sample - Challenge: Identify the CnC address among all traffic (scanning, infiltration etc.)
 Demo 2: Given the malware and IP addresses, find a live CnC server
- Malware: Gafgyt - The target address: CnC of Gafgyt/Mirai/BashLite (according to VT) CnC

Takeaway messages
 We need to proactively scan the Internet and find CnC servers because:
- CnC servers are very short lived - IoT malware communication protocols are diverse and complex; hence, real malware is needed for probing
 CnC Hunter provides a CnC discovery solution via Man-In-The-Middling malware
- CnC Hunter is fully automated - CnC Hunter is open source
