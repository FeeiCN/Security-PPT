Limitations of university servers and infrastructure

indicator of ghost account

Beyond Raw Numbers...
Practical Considerations:
 What's the impact?  Is there a political divide?  Sharing by news sources?  Foreign interest?  Industry behaviors?  Sharing as function of:
 Gender  Race  Location / address
 How relevant is the content?  Does the organization stop
when I ask them to?  Can we predict how much an
organization will send us?

Quantifying the Impact

Death by 1000 papercuts 1226
Let's estimate the amount of time wasted over
9 months if we actually paid attention to the
glut of information sent to us from a one-time
interaction.
 Voicemails = 5 minute distraction  Texts = 1 minute distraction  Email = 15 second distraction

Open Source Dataset
Whitepaper posted to Blackhat website
Dataset offered to other researchers:
 Raw data*:
 16436 emails  3482 phonecalls  949 voicemails  774 texts  *purchase data and private emails used for testing excised
 Information for 300 fake identities
 Assignments to 185 entities, manufactured biases  Passwords omitted; all accounts disabled
 171 privacy policies with scoring rubrics  Various scripts and tools for automating analysis

https://humeESL.github.io/Use-and-Abuse-PII/

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

Key Takeaways

Small scale experiment intended testing feasibility of PII traceability
- Addition of phone services ($$) offered rich insights into phone/text behaviors - Respected companies do not generally share PII - Prototyped a quantitative scoring method for privacy policies and terms of service - Observe trends for PII use & abuse within industries and specific outliers - Surprisingly little domestic political interest from foreign accounts - Collection mechanisms very constrained

Future experiment with 100k identities; seek answers to:

 Where is bulk spam activity and malicious content originating?  Can we improve traceability of personal information, particularly phone/SMS?  Can we improve anonymized tracking and cookie tracing activity?  Best ways to stimulate "activity" in automated fashion?  Do companies treat account holders differently as a function of gender, race, age,

geography, or any other measurable criteria?  Special interest questions: politics, timing, OSINT fusion  Is a crowd sourced interface / open sourced analysis feasible?
