DoS

 Temporary file creation

 Disk space usage

o In writable directories new files temporarily create a .crswap file

 These are worth noting but low severity

o If conflicting writes, multiple crswap files will be created, numbered

o Numbers go up to 99 then failures occur

o This can be forced, or in certain circumstances can happen as the result of a bug

Remote code execution (RCE)--binary planting

 Many applications load various libraries (dynamic link library's [DLL] on Windows) at startup
 DLL search path is a complicated topic dependent on various settings, but often includes the current directory
 If a DLL isn't a standard system DLL the current directory may be checked for it

 When a program is started by doubleclicking a file in explorer, current directory is the same as the file
 If a website has been granted folder write access via file access API, it can write a DLL!
 Many of these bugs were released in 2010, referencing file shares especially
 Same concept applies to other commands a program executes

RCE--sleight of hand explanation

Normal download flow  User opens site  User clicks to download a
small script to run  Save prompt for file with
name  User examines file--
SmartScreen checks  User runs file

Attack
 Users opens site  User clicks to download a
small script to run  Save prompt for file without
name  User examines file--
SmartScreen checks  User runs file  Page edits file  Modified commands run

RCE--sleight of hand explanation

Normal download flow  Site can only suggest
extension  Website only has write access
once
Copyright  2021 Deloitte Development LLC. All rights reserved.  Information Classification: General

Attack  Site can force extension  Website can re-access file
o Re-access requires whole file lock and replacement
o Execution types that maintain handles are generally not vulnerable
Internal affairs 12

Forensic artifacts
 Browser cache and other forensics  Timelines  Modification attack
o Watch for file creation/modification dates o Deleted temporary file entries may still exist in MFT

full name  Actions to avoid--
downloading without  Close your tab before
touching files

Browser level
 Blocking script files  Lock file for entire duration of
potential access  Add user approval prompt for
R/W access  Visual indication for ongoing
access, similar to camera/ microphone
