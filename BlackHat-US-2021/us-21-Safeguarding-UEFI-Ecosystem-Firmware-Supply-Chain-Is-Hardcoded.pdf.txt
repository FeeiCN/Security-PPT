NVRAM Variables Access During Boot Flow
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

NVRAM PEI/DXE/SMM Threat Model
Attacker Model: The local attacker uses privileged host OS access to trigger the vulnerability gaining PEI/DXE stage code execution in System Management Mode (SMM).
Potential Impact: PEI/DXE code execution in SMM context allows potential installation of persistent implants in the NVRAM SPI flash region. Implant persistence across OS installations, can further bypass Secure Boot attacking guest VM's in bare metal cloud deployments.
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

NVRAM Persistence on SPI Flash
и NVRAM region is not protected by Intel Boot Guard and can be abused by attacker with physical access (supply chain vector).

и Arbitrary code execution via GetVariable() and memory leak over SetVariable() is common, attacker can modify persistent NVRAM storage and install fileless DXE/SMM/PEI implant (shellcode).

Most security solutions inspect only UEFI drivers!

Pre-EFI Initialization and NVRAM variables

и PEI code also reads configuration data from NVRAM variables и By design, NVRAM is considered read only in PEI stage и EFI variables are as good attack surface for PEI as they are for DXE и The API for reading EFI vars is a bit different for PEI though

#define EFI_PEI_READ_ONLY_VARIABLE2_PPI_GUID \ { 0x2ab86ef5, 0xecb5, 0x4134, { 0xb5, 0x56, 0x38, 0x54, 0xca, 0x1f,
0xe1, 0xb4 } }

Scan for this GUID to quickly locate PEI code that reads NVRAM variables (and potentially has vulns that have to be fixed)
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

Pre-EFI Initialization and NVRAM variables
This is an example of EFI var reading from UncoreInitPeim.efi running on Grantley, and there are problems.
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

How to know when your Uncore is up to no good
и No status check after GetVariable() и DataSize may become larger than 2048 bytes if GetVariable() call fails with
EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL (that is, if "syscg" NVRAM variable is longer than 2048 bytes) и No check for a return value of AllocatePool() и memcpy() will not overflow syscg, but may copy some stack memory to it
This is not particularly useful but looks like this code may be full of surprises. Let's see what it does next.
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

Hey Uncore, GetVariable() API is dangerous when called in a loop
It may change DataSize and you overflow your buffer on the next iteration with an attacker-controlled data if you don't check the returned state:
This code reads a chain of EFI variables. Each var contains a name of the next one in the beginning of the data.
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

Hey Uncore, GetVariable() API is dangerous when called in a loop
It may change DataSize and you overflow your buffer on the next iteration with an attacker-controlled data if you don't check the returned state:
DataSize is not reinitialized before GetVariable(). Therefore, DataSize value is controlled by an attacker.
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

Hey Uncore, GetVariable() API is dangerous when called in a loop
It may change DataSize and you overflow your buffer on the next iteration with an attacker-controlled data if you don't check the returned state:
ChunkName is a stack buffer. When GetVariable encounters a large var (length > DataSize), DataSize is overwritten with the actual length. On the next iteration a stack overflow occurs when GetVariable() assumes ChunkName length is at least DataSize bytes.
This stack buffer is overflowed. We don't have stack cookies or ASLR in PEI code. #BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

We don't even need to exploit this stack overflow to make our unsigned code execute during PEI.
This feature was designed to run arbitrary unsigned code blobs stored in EFI variables!

Uncore features unsigned module loading

What is the purpose of this feature?
This was intended to be used for debugging or testing purposes.
Intel guidance is this feature is not supposed to be enabled if a physical presence has not been established.
BIOS vendors are supposed to implement their own code for establishing physical presence. For example, a physical jumper setting may be used.
If this feature is not used by OEM vendors then this feature should not be compiled in.

What is the purpose of this feature?

BIOS vendors are supposed to implement their own code for establishing physical presence. For example, a physical jumper setting may be used.
This is what a poor implementation looks like:
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

Not all BIOS vendors are oblivious to the guidelines
Dell has permanently disabled a setup knob setting for this feature, making the module loading code unreachable. Good job!
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

How did it happen?
1. Intel implemented a dummy function for a physical presence which always returns TRUE. Should have put "return FALSE".
2. IBVs have been told by Intel to implement the code which checks for physical jumpers etc. 3. Instead, IBVs just reused Intel's reference code implementation without making any changes
to the relevant code. Now Grantley+ server platforms have this presence check effectively disabled because of this.
"Reference implementations" often become the defacto implementation -- due care with proper (safe) defaults should be the norm.

Actual bug is here

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

CVE-2021-0114: Intel's response
и BSSA Target-Based Loader is a Design for Manufacturing (DFx) feature intended to be used on manufacturing lines.
и Intel's Implementation and Security Guidelines state this feature is not intended to be included in production use, but if it is included then it must be further secured. A suggested method is to confirm physical presence and would vary by different motherboards and systems each requiring their own implementation.
и Transparency is part of our security first pledge. Intel has published an Intel« BSSA DFT Advisory (INTEL-SA-00525) and has developed updated reference UEFI Firmware for potentially affected platforms which includes a physical presence check that always returns False thus necessitating IBV's to complete the implementation for a specific motherboard or system if they included this DFx feature in production.

Looking up the details
Let's look up the GUID for "toolh" and "syscg" EFI variables used by this feature.

So, the feature is called "SSA".
And the payload is probably called "SystemAgent"
