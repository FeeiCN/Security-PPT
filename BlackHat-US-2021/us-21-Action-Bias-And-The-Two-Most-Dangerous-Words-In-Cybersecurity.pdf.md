ACTION BIAS

ACTION BIAS in CYBERSECURITY
ACTION BIAS is the impulse to act to gain a sense of
control over a situation and eliminate a problem, and is particularly likely to occur if others expect us to act.
IN CYBERSECURITY, Action Bias can lead to increased
risk and damage from various events; and is approached differently by users, administrators or executives.

IMMEDIATE vs. NON-IMMEDIATE ACTION
 Some situations DO require immediate action.  We are not suggesting you let bad things happen.  Have a plan and follow the plan.

The TWO MOST DANGEROUS WORDS in CYBERSECURITY
NEVER AGAIN

COUNTERMEASURES to ACTION BIAS

COUNTERMEASURES to ACTION BIAS

 Validation of threats  Simplify and normalize deep thought vs a reflex  Evolve the mental models
