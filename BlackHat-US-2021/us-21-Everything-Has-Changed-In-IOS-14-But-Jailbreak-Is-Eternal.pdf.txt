About me
 Fan, Zuozhi (@pattern_F_)  Ant Security, Tianqiong Lab  Started macOS/iOS security from the second half of 2019  speaker of Black Hat ASIA 2021
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

About the talk
 ModernPwner released the first workable iOS 14 kernel exploit. Opened a new chapter of iOS 14 jailbreak.
 I published a stable kernel r/w primitive firstly  I will show how to run unauthorized code on iOS 14  This talk is about my iOS 14 learning journey

iOS 14 vs iOS 13
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

Why it's so hard to pwn iOS 14
 New mitigations introduced in iOS 14
kernel heap hardening data PAC userspace PAC hardening tfp0 hardening ipc_kmsg hardening etc.
 Some works on the vulnerability stage  Some works on the exploit stage
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

kernel heap isolation
 kheap isolation is not new, but is hardened massively
 try to stop UAF (overlap freed object with different objects)
 kalloc heap is split into 4 types  kernel objects and kext objects can't see each other
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

kheap isolation hardening
 OSData & OSString contents are moved into DATA heap (no pointer or offset). Reduce the risk to build fake object.

 More and more kobjects are moved into dedicate zones (they are disappeared in common heap)

 kheap in iOS 14 is fine-grained

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

data PAC
 Data PAC: newly introduced in iOS14  Signing strategy: discriminator(string hash) + memory address
 can't touch any bits of the data pointers  can't use the pointer in other places
 code PAC - control-flow integrity  data PAC - data integrity
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

data PAC, not only pointers
 Using DB key to sign uint32

 Using GA key to sign blob (multi bytes)
 ptrauth_utils_sign_blob_generic
 PAC is a victory for black-box

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

userspace PAC hardening
 In iOS 13, attackers can forge A-key protected function pointers in other process
 The A keys are used for primarily "global" purposes. These keys are sometimes called process-independent.
 Apple decides to break the definition of A keys. Now IA key also becomes process-dependent.
 Try to stop cross-process attack
 PAC document leaked?
 xnu-7195.60.75/doc/pac.md  xnu-7195.81.3/doc/pac.md [deleted]
 But jailbreak also need to control other process, i.e. amfid  With kernel r/w, it is possible to bypass it
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

tfp0 hardening
 tfp0, the most convenient way to achieve kernel r/w
 With Ian Beer's fake port technique, almost every kernel exploit tries to build a tfp0
 For PAC(A12+) devices, add PAC to protect kernel_task  For pre-A12 devices, add checks to prevent userspace to resolve
kernel_task / to use kernel_pmap  We must find alternatives of tfp0 to achieve kernel r/w
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

kmsg, an exploit-friendly kobject
 Not only heap spray  With kmsg, you can convert a two-byte heap overflow (in
kalloc_large area) to a full exploit  characteristics of ipc_kmsg
 variable-sized  link pointer (self location ability)
 key idea
 modify ikm_size to free more memory
 kmsg lives in
 zone ipc.kmsgs (size 256)  kalloc.288 ~ (size > 256)
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

exploit based on kmsg is dead
 ipc_kmsg was hardened in iOS 14.2
 control part went to zone  data part went to KHEAP_DATA
 Apple's smart idea, destroy the essential exploit primitives
 RIP my first iOS kernel bug.
 Without ipc_kmsg, I'm not able to exploit it. It only works on iOS 14.1.
 I can't find an alternative to kmsg yet
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

the first public iOS 14 kernel exploit
 CVE-2021-1782: A race condition in user_data_get_value() leading to ivac entry UAF
 Fixed in iOS 14.4Jan 26, 2021  Synacktiv's blog post details this vuln, Feb 10 [link]  ModernPwner published a workable exploit cicuta_virosa, with
kernel r/w, Feb 10 [link]
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

r/w primitives by cicuta_virosa
 Why pktopts? Why not OSData, or kmsg to lay out kheap? - kheap isolation  limitation 1: The kernel r/w relies on free-realloc operation to fill the
memory hole. That's not very stable. You can't use this frequently.
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

write_20 limitation of cicuta_virosa
 write_20 failed sometimes, why?  bsd/netinet6/ip6_output.c  ipi6_ifindex < if_index

 limitation 2: write_20 writes 16-byte data plus 4-byte 0

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

we need new r/w primitives
 We must build stable & unlimited kernel r/w primitives  Before, we had tfp0, the perfect kernel r/w
 mach_vm_read_overwrite / mach_vm_write  mach_vm_allocate / mach_vm_deallocate
 Now bye bye tfp0 - tfp0 hardening  Let's find new r/w primitives, not write limited, and stable  Key idea: transform other kernel object that can be easily
accessed from userspace
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

IOSurface
 "Exploiting IOSurface 0", by Chen Liang [link]  IOSurface is a good candidate  IOSurface is frequently used in kernel exploit
 heap spray, leak memory info, or forge kobjects
 lots of external methods
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

IOSurface in userspace
 userspace: surface ID  IOSurface.dylib: IOSurfaceSetValue(IOSurfaceRef, ...)
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

s_set_indexed_timestamp

 If we control ptr IOSurface.field_360, we get an 8-byte write  write address: IOSurface.field_360  call chain: does not touch any other class field, no side effect  I think write_20 (16-byte data + 4-byte 0) is ok

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

s_get_ycbcrmatrix

 If we control ptr surface, we get an 4-byte read  read address: IOSurfaceClient.surface + 0xb4  call chain: does not touch any other class field, no side effect  I think write_20 (16-byte data + 4-byte 0) is ok

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

shared memory with kernel
 If it's possible, I choose shared memory to modify kernel data. Convenient!
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

stable kernel r/w primitive
 convert read_20/write_20 to stable kernel r/w  use it as the alternative of tfp0  share the kernel r/w with other process, libkrw by Siguza [link]
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

post-exploit
 Let's do the "jailbreak" thing  my goal - execute unauthorized code (binary)  Just porting FreeTheSandbox, by ZecOps [link], to cicuta_virosa  Solve the troubles I met in the porting progress
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

disable sandbox
 Just nullify the sandbox slot  fork()/execve(), posix_spawn()
 a "flaw" in data PAC  nullptr is not signed or checked  It is safe to null any data
pointer (in most cases)  For performance considerations -
memset(kobject, 0) & .bss

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

TrustCache? CoreTrust?
 CoreTrust's purpose is to thwart the common technique of "fake-signing" (known to jailbreakers as "ldid -S" or "jtool --sign"), which is often used to deploy arbitrary binaries to a jailbroken device. - iOS internals
 Sign stuff with a cert (it could be any kind of cert, free, paid, expired or revoked, as long as it comes from Apple it's good) - Jake James's paper
 For real jailbreak tools, it's better to bypass CoreTrust, or you need to sign the binaries immediately after you installed a package
 We need kernel PAC bypass to do the kcall things, or PPL bypass
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

amfid bypass
 task port + task_set_exception_ports  Let's write a debugger for amfid!
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

entitlements hack
 task_for_pid needs entitlement "task_for_pid-allow"  FreeTheSandbox borrows p_ucred from other process, then we have
the same entitlements with that process.  /usr/sbin/spindump has that entitlement
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

data PAC everywhere?
 But, almost everything is protected by PAC!  Let's lock at the low-level data structure  Entitlements are stored in OSDictionary. dictEntry is not PAC'd!
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

build entitlements library
 Entitlements of MAC label is stored in OSDictionary  Properties attached to IOSurface is stored in OSDictionary too  So, we can put all the entitlements we need into the IOSurface
values in advance

 IOSurface is really a treasure!

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

amfid bypass, the last trouble
 We got task port of process amfid
 task_set_exception_ports - install an exception handler (I'm a debugger)  vm_write - check and modify amfid's memory  thread_set_state - control amfid's registers
 Steps to bypass amfid
 Redirect MISValidateSignatureAndCopyInfo to invalid address  Catch the exception  Calculate the right CDHash to satisfy AMFI check  thread_state_t.__opaque_pc = pacia < return address >, resume amfid
 iOS 13 - OK, iOS 14 - fail!
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

userspace PAC magic
 operations behind thread_set_state

 thread_set_state will use target thread's jop_pid to decode the pc we specified

 PAC IA key: jop_pid

 amfid uses a different IA key - userspace PAC hardening

 So amfid got an invalid pc (signed by our own IA key), then it crushes again

 We must sign the pc register with amfid's IA key

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

userspace PAC hack (1)
 operations behind thread_get_state
 So,
 thread_set_state - auth pc register  thread_get_state - sign pc register
  If we steal amfid's IA key...
 With kernel r/w, we know what amfid's IA key (machine.jop_pid) is. Let's use some tricks to calc a correct (amfid) signed pc.
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

userspace PAC hack (1)
 Sacrifice a dummy thread. No side effect if we suspend it.
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

userspace PAC hack (2)
 I found a mig call by accident - thread_convert_thread_state  A perfect "bypass"  No kernel r/w required, if you can get target's thread port
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

userspace PAC hack (2)
 This "bypass" is simple.
 This API is useless, except that you debug a process that doesn't belong to you
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

amfid bypass, done
 Steps to bypass amfid
 Redirect MISValidateSignatureAndCopyInfo to invalid address  Catch the exception  Calculate the right CDHash to satisfy AMFI check  thread_state_t.__opaque_pc = pacia(amfid) < return address >, resume amfid
 iOS 14 - OK!
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

Put them all together

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

Summary
 Maybe iOS 14 is the most secure iOS ever
 kheap isolation - kill vulnerabilities  data PAC - kill exploit primitives
 Jailbreak is unstoppable, but high-quality bugs are required  I learned everything from the community. cicuta_virosa gives me
the opportunity to contribute to iOS hack community.  TQ-pre-jailbreak is fully open source now. Hope this is helpful
to researchers.
