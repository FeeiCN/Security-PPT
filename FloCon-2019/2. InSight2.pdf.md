Prediction of Large Data-transfers
 Markov chain
 Deterministic finite-state machine where, given the present state, future transitions only depend on the current state:   0, ... -1) =   -1)  ,
 Steady-state probabilities
 Expected number of times each state contributes to infinitely long realization: Solve   = 
 Mean first passage time
 Expected number of transitions from given state till another state is reached: , = 1 +  , ,

 RED Alert Algorithm (Recursive Event Detection).  Uses tensors as storage containers for data.  Based on multi-linear algebra theory.
Num. active known Botnets

Botnet presence estimate based on num. conn.

Host IPs identified by automatically filtering data
