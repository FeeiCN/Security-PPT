Motivation
 Analyst identifies events of interest inside their network.
 Example: Remote process executed on a Windows desktop.
 Analyst wants to isolate any external connections related to this event.
 Example: A user who connects remotely to computer from home and runs a command.

Challenges

Event logging may not capture sufficient connection details.

Direct connections from external source to end points are rare.
Typically involve layered firewalls, routers, load balancers, public
facing servers (VPN, web, RDP).

Limitations and Assumptions

 Issue : Overlapping connections.
 Multiple instances of same Ci overlapping a single event Ej (left)  Distinct instance of Ci overlapping a single event Ej (right)

IP1

IP1

IP2

E2
Assumption: Treat union of overlapping source as single session

E2
Assumption: An event is only attributable to a single connection

 Issue: Connections without events; events before/after connections.
 Assumption: Assume inconsequential; pair with null event / null connection.

 Issue: Clock differences.

 Assumption: insignificant; Handled with "fuzzing"

PROTOTYPE 1 Count Pairs

Prototype 1: Count Pairs
Given: C, a set of external connections with start time (ts) and end time (te) E, a set of internal events with start time (ts)
b = [0..C,0..E] For each Connection Ci , i = 0..C For each Event Ej, j = 0..E
if ts(Ej) >= ts(Ci) and ts(Ej) <= te(Ci) b[Ci,Ej]++
11

Prototype 1: Results

Example: EventFKCOJCQC is an account logon..
 Works very well under the following conditions:
 Frequent Ci, Ej combinations.  Ej does not underlap many other connections.  Targeted hunt (i.e., you know what you are looking for).

..occurs within connection from 141.230.198.201 many times.. Check it out

 Challenges
 Interpreting/prioritizing many event-connection pairs of interest  O(E x C) performance at scale

PROTOTYPE 2 Independence

Prototype 2: Independence Testing

 For each pair (Ci, Ej), construct contingency table.

i

Ej

 
  (  ,   )

=1 =1

Ej

 
  ( ,  = )

=1 =1

i
 
  (= ,   )
=1 =1  
   = ,  = 
=1 =1

 Perform chi-square test for independence.
 H0 : Ci and Ej are independent.  Ha: Ci and Ej are not independent.

Prototype 2 : Parallelizing
 Implemented in R.  Algorithm easily parallelized.
 Implemented using parallel library (native to R-base 3.4 and above).  No additional libraries required (runs with U.S. Army DISA DoDIN
certified R).  Distribute (C,E) pairs among n-cores.

 p-value is compared to significance level  = 0.05  If p  0.05, reject H0
H0 : Ci and Ej are independent
 If p  0.05, reject H0  evidence suggests an association exists between Ci and Ej  Provides a tool for prioritizing analytic output

Conclusions
Goal: Design an analytic that identifies connections corresponding to malicious events.
 Result: Approach is viable.
 Ideal conditions:
 Very infrequent occurrences of connection related to malicious event
 Very frequent non-correlated, nonrelated connections
 Larger number of non-correlated events
 Technique maintains decent false positive rates.
26

Limitations and Future Work
 More simulation!
 Use realistic simulation parameters.  Explore other interarrival distributions.
 Only modeled events within connections. What about connections that follow events?
 Need to complete full-scale testing.
 Limitations and assumptions of non-parametric test.
 Treated connection pairs independently. Is this good?  Better approach: Queuing theory!
