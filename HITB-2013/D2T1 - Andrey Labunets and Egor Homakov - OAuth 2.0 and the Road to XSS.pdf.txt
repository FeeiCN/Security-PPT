OAuth 2.0 Case Study: Facebook Platform
Motivation:
 OAuth 2.0 -- proposed RFC standard  Facebook -- largest platform for web-developers (1b users, 9m apps)  Poorly explored, huge attack surface
4

Assumptions and threat model
 A victim has an account on Facebook, and he uses some apps  An attacker is able create a malicious web site and a malicious
Facebook app  An attacker can convince a victim to click a specially crafted
malicious link  Attacker wants to:
 Access victim's private data  Invoke some actions on behalf of a victim  Sign into his account on a third-party web site (authentication bypass)  Execute its code on facebook.com client-side (XSS)
5

Legacy authorization flow

Legacy authorization flow
 extern/login_status.php returns token in query string  Exploitation:
 Insert a picture from your server somewhere inside the Client site  Tamper redirect_uri to point this page  Let the user click the link
 Resource owner's access token leaked via HTTP Referrer
7

Legacy authorization flow
http://facebook.com/extern/login_status.php?api_key=111239619098&ok_session=http%3A%2F %2Fwww.bing.com%2Fcommunity%2Fwebmaster%2Ff%2F12251%2Fp%2F675833%2F...
HTTP 302
8

Legacy authorization flow
 Lots of external developers depend on this flow, not easy to patch  Still works for some apps (bing, etc)  Impact:
 Access token stealing
 Lessons:
 Design it carefully  If not, don't mix legacy/latest auth flows

Javascript SDK issues

Normal JS SDK workflow

Trusted Client

JS SDK

postMessage()

Facebook proxy iframe
xd_arbiter.php?version=18#...origin=app.com...

proxyMessage()

Facebook auth window
xd_arbiter.php?version=18#...origin=client.com...&signed_request=...&token=...
11

Flaw in JS SDK proxy

Evil Facebook Client

JS SDK

postMessage()

Facebook proxy iframe
xd_arbiter.php#...origin=evil.com...

proxyMessage()
dst/src origins were never compared

Facebook auth window
xd_arbiter.php#...origin=client.com...&signed_request=...&token=...

12

Flaw in JS SDK proxy
 Exploited by setting redirect_uri to an old-versioned xd_proxy without origin checks
 Impact:
 Code, access token, signed_request stealing
 Lessons:
 If this is out of specs, implement in twice carefully
 Suggestion:
 Make JS SDK xd_arbiter open-source
13

URL fragment tricks

Hash-bang (#!) + Referrer exploitation
 Facebook QuicklingPrelude (or hash-bang feature):
 Fills location with value from location.hash  Redirect: facebook.com/#!/whatever --> facebook.com/whatever  Abused to pull sensitive data from URL fragment
 Generic idea of all hash-bang + Referrer exploits:
 Redirect to a permitted page at facebook.com  Pull access token from fragment and redirect to another facebook page  Redirect to your own domain  Pick the Referrer from the request and extract the token
15

App RPC getHash trick
 Facebook app controller implemented a special getHash method (possibly, for app navigation or parameter passing)
 top.location.hash could be disclosed to a malicious app iframe  No need to authorize the malicious app  Exploitation:
 Utilize hash-bang feature to bypass filters on redirect_uri  Redirect to your app canvas page  Invoke FB_RPC call getHash from your app  Get a full URL fragment with access token
16

App RPC getHash trick

Facebook.com
3. proxyMessage("FB_RPC:...result:"access_token=AAA...",...)

2. XdArbiter.handleMessage()

App.com Canvas iframe 1. postMessage("FB_RPC...method:getHash...",..)

4. postMessage("FB_RPC:...result:"access_token=AAA...",...)
Facebook proxy iframe

17

URL fragment tricks
 Fragment-based navigation is an excellent vector for OAuth 2.0  Impact:
 code, access token, signed_request stealing
 Lessons:
 Avoid navigation with URL fragment on your authorization endpoint domain  If not, deny any redirect_uri containing URL fragment  If not, think twice how you integrate your fragment navigation with OAuth 2.0
18

PHP SDK issues

PHP SDK issues
 OAuth 2.0: stealing code via redirect_uri tampering gives nothing
 Facebook JS/PHP SDK: code is issued with an empty redirect_uri:
src/base_facebook.php#L426 protected function getUserAccessToken() { ... // the JS SDK puts a code in with the redirect_uri of '' if (array_key_exists('code', $signed_request)) { $code = $signed_request['code']; ... $access_token = $this->getAccessTokenFromCode($code, ''); ...
 redirect_uri tampering-based attacks are invisible
20

PHP SDK issues
signed_request takes priority over code-based authentication:
src/base_facebook.php#L525
protected function getUserFromAvailableData() { // if a signed request is supplied, then it solely determines // who the user is. $signed_request = $this->getSignedRequest(); if ($signed_request) { if (array_key_exists('user_id', $signed_request)) { $user = $signed_request['user_id'];
signed_request parsed also from $_REQUEST, no CSRF checks:
src/base_facebook.php#L489
public function getSignedRequest() { if (!$this->signedRequest) { if (!empty($_REQUEST['signed_request'])) { $this->signedRequest = $this->parseSignedRequest( $_REQUEST['signed_request']);
21

PHP SDK issues
 PHP SDK compromises OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant flow  Still not patched  Impact:
 Downgrade attack (from code grant to signed_request -based flow)  Session fixation (CSRF) with signed_request  redirect_uri tampering and stolen signed_request means authentication bypass
 Lessons:
 Facebook PHP SDK is not for secure authentication  Don't trust code from external SDK
22

RPC issues

Facebook RPC showDialog workflow
 App communicate with Facebook RPC controller through FB_RPC messages
 App can invoke a special RPC method showDialog  To render the dialog, Facebook controller makes an XHR
request and parses the JSON payload  XHR endpoint uiserver.php also serves as OAuth 2.0 endpoint  We control most of query parameters for uiserver.php (redirect_uri)
24

Facebook RPC showDialog workflow

uiserver.php
3. XHR

Facebook.com

4. XHR handler 2. XdArbiter.handleMessage()

app.com canvas iframe

1. postMessage() / Flash

Facebook proxy iframe

25

Facebook RPC showDialog workflow
Guess, how is JSON payload parsed?
26

Facebook RPC showDialog workflow

We could trick the Facebook app controller with OAuth 2.0 redirects and submit malicious payload to the XHR handler:

_handleXHRResponse: function(ka) { var la; if (this.getOption('suppressEvaluation')) { la = {asyncResponse: new h(this, ka)}; } else { var ma = ka.responseText, na = null; try { var pa = this._unshieldResponseText(ma); try { var qa = (eval)('(' + pa + ')');

Disabled by default Removes the first 9 bytes
Yes, just eval

XHR cross-domain redirects are not permitted, but let's knock it down up to cross-site scripting anyway
27

Yet another JS SDK issue: Flash XD transport
 redirect_uri parameter of showDialog method must belong to app's own domain, which is defined in xd_arbiter proxy url
 Two flaws in Flash cross-domain transport allowed to hijack the origin and to send FB_RPC messages on behalf of facebook.com:
 Controllable Flash channel names  Absense of secret nonce validation
 Exploitation:
 Inject two xd_arbiter proxies with transport=flash  Connect them by setting the same Flash channel name  Inject the third xd_arbiter and let him initiate the flow with proxyMessage()
28

Yet another JS SDK issue: Flash XD transport

Facebook App

Secret nonce validation -- insufficient, another nonce check here is missing

JS SDK

Facebook auth window

Adobe LocalConnection() channel names are controlled by xd_arbiter url
proxyMessage()

29

XSS with OAuth 2.0

 Now we send FB_RPC message on behalf of facebook.com and invoke showDialog method

_unshieldResponseText cuts the prefix

 redirect_uri parameter in FB_RPC message is http:/facebook.com/...something, and it passes all checks

 Wrapping a small stage-0 malicious payload inside a picture

 Proxying the picture from our site through facebook.com/safe_image.php

3. redirect_uri = gif

2. .connection.send()

31

XSS with OAuth 2.0
 Lessons:
 XSS is not only about ?q=<script>alert(, design flaws are unique  eval is still evil, nothing new  OAuth redirects can be abused for taint propagation in your javascript apps
