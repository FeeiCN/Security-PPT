Any input is a program.

 unmapped/bad memory reference trap, based on page tables & (current) IDT
 hardware writes fault info on the stack - where it thinks the stack is (address in TSS)
 If we point "stack" into page tables, GDT or TSS, can we get the "tape" of a Turing machine?

ITS A TRAP

OpenWall
 Solar Designer, 1999  cf. "Stack Smashing for Fun and
Profit"
 CS limit is 3GB - 8MB (for stack)
 Code fetch from the stack is trapped
 See if the current instruction is a RET
 Very specific threat, allows JIT, etc.  (And many other hardening
patches)
Wednesday, April 10, 13

PaX
 PaX is an awesome Linux hardening patch  Many 'firsts' on real-world OS's, e.g. NX on
Intel and ASLR (PaX in 2000, OpenBSD in 2003)
 PaX has NX on all CPUs since the Pentium (Intel has hardware support since P4)  SEGMEXEC and PAGEEXEC  Leverages difference between instruction and data memory paths
Wednesday, April 10, 13

PaX NX: SegmExec
 Instruction: Virtual address = Linear + CS.base  Data: VA= Linear + {DS,ES,FS,GS,SS}.base  3GB user space  Set all segment limits to 1.5 GB (so all pointers
are less than 1.5GB)
 Data access goes to lower half of VA space  Instruction fetch goes to upper half of VA space
Wednesday, April 10, 13

PaX NX: PageExec
 "split TLB" (iTLB for fetches, dTLB for loads) [Plex86 1997, to detect self-modifying code: http://pax.grsecurity.net/docs/pageexec.old.txt]
 TLBs are not synchronized with page tables in RAM (manually flushed every time tables change)
 NX ~ User/Supervisor bit
Wednesday, April 10, 13

PageExec data lookup

If U=1
TLB
"Fast path" Not found

Access

Pagetable

Always U=0 in PTE
#PF fault
Normal data
if EIP=addr, instruction

Set user bit, read one byte to
fill TLB, clear user bit

Terminate
Wednesday, April 10, 13

OllyBone: Trap on end of unpacker
 Same TLB technique as PaX  Debugger plugin to analyze (un)packers  Want to break execution on a memory
range (so you trap every time you exec after writing)
 The idea goes back to Plex86 (before PaX) who tried to do virtualization that way
Wednesday, April 10, 13

ShadowWalker
 When a rootkit detector scans the code (as
data!), why not give a different page than when the code is executed?
 Instead of having different User bits, we could
also have different page frame numbers (trap on P=0 in pagetables)
Wednesday, April 10, 13

Trap-based "Design Patterns"
 Overloading #PF for security policy, labeling memory (e.g., PaX, OpenWall)
 Combining traps to trap on more complex events (OllyBone,"fetch from a page just written")
 Using several trap bits in different locations to label memory for data flow control (PaX UDEREF, SMAP/SMEP use)
 Storing extra state in TLBs (PaX PageExec)  "Unorthodox" breakpoints, control flow, ...
Wednesday, April 10, 13

What's in a trap handler (let's roll our own)
Wednesday, April 10, 13

IDT entries:
... 8: #DF
... 14: #PF
...
Wednesday, April 10, 13

Call through a Trap Gate
32 bit? nested interrupts?
New code segment Like a FAR call of old. If the new segment is in a lower (i.e. higher privilege) Ring, we load a new SP.
Wednesday, April 10, 13

Pushes parameters to "handler's stack"
These two are only pushed if we changed the stack
ESP
"IRET" instruction can return from this
Wednesday, April 10, 13

What if this fails?
 Stack invalid?  Code segment invalid?  IDT entry not present?
Causes "Double Fault"(#8)."Triple fault" = Reboot Usually DF means OS bug, so a lot of state might be corrupted (i.e. invalid kernel stack)
Wednesday, April 10, 13

Hardware Task Switching
Can use it for #PF and #DF traps instead of Trap Gates
TR
Wednesday, April 10, 13

Task gate
 (unused) mechanism for hardware tasking  Reloads (nearly) all CPU state from memory  Task gate causes task switch on trap
Wednesday, April 10, 13

IDT GDT

(addressed indirectly through GDT)

IDT-> GDT->TSS
It still pushes the error code

Wednesday, April 10, 13

Interrupt to Task Gate

1. Save state to location pointed to by TR

2. Find Task (GDT), validate + check Busy=0

3. Load new state

4. Push error code

Doublefault

Begin executing new EIP

Wednesday, April 10, 13

Implementation sketch:
 If EIP of a handler is pointed at invalid memory, we get another page fault immediately; keep EIP invalid in all tasks
 Var Decrement: use TSS' SP, pushing the stack decrements SP by 4.
 Branch: <4 or not? Implemented by double fault when SP cannot be decremented
Wednesday, April 10, 13

Dramatis Personae I
 One GDT to rule them all  One TSS Descriptor per instruction,
aligned with the end of a page
 IDT is mapped differently, per instruction  A target (branch-not-taken) in Int 14, #PF  B target (branch taken) in Int 8, #DF
Wednesday, April 10, 13

Dramatis Personae II
 Higher half of TSS (variables)  Map A.Y, B.Y (the value we want to load
for next instruction) at their TSS addresses
 map X (the value we want to write) at the addr of the current task
 So we have the move and decrement
Wednesday, April 10, 13

 We split these TSS across a page boundary
 Variables are stack pointer entries in a TSS
 Upper Page: ESP and segments
 Lower Page: EAX, ECX, EIP, CR3 (page tables)

Label:

#PF/DF: "rising edge" of a clock tick
Saving old TSS state Loading new TSS state Attempt to save fault info to stack
(decrement ESP, write info to stack)
Failure: #DF (decr ESP is invalid) Success: (decr ESP, write info)
First instruction of new task:
causes #PF (new EIP is invalid, too)

Wednesday, April 10, 13

1 bit(ch) of a bit(ch)
CPU won't load task if this is set
We need to overwrite it. Luckily, the CPU always saves all the state (even if not dirty).
So: map the lower half of TSS over GDT, so that saved EAX,ECX from TSS overwrite descriptor;
same content, only busy bit cleared.
