ABOUT MOBILEBACKUP2

 MobileBackup2 has a set of backup domains  Backup domains define 'allowed' paths  Adding arbitrary files is not possible everywhere  But there are several usable paths, e.g.
MediaDomain:Media/Recordings
(/var/mobile/Media/Recordings)

Swiping through modern security features, HITB, AMS 2013
jeudi 11 avril 13

@evad3rs

ABOUT MOBILEBACKUP2

 Backup restore process changed with iOS 6  Files are created in /var/tmp, staged (renamed)
to another directory in /var, and finally renamed to its destination
 Obviously limits writing files to /var partition since rename doesn't work across filesystems

Swiping through modern security features, HITB, AMS 2013
jeudi 11 avril 13

@evad3rs

DIRECTORY TRAVERSAL

 For accessing a path outside the allowed ones we just add a symlink to the backup, e.g.: Media/Recordings/haxx with haxx pointing to /var/mobile
 When the backup is restored, MB2 restores
Media/Recordings/haxx/DemoApp.app
but it actually writes
/var/mobile/DemoApp.app

Swiping through modern security features, HITB, AMS 2013
jeudi 11 avril 13

@evad3rs

ADDING EVASI0N ICON

 So to finally add the icon we use MB2 to write what we need:

/var/mobile/Library/Caches/ com.apple.mobile.installation.plist
/var/mobile/DemoApp.app /var/mobile/DemoApp.app/DemoApp /var/mobile/DemoApp.app/Info.plist /var/mobile/DemoApp.app/Icon.png /var/mobile/DemoApp.app/Icon@2x.png ...
 Reboot device...

@evad3rs

EXECUTING LAUNCHCTL

 The replaced DemoApp binary we just injected with MB2 is a script with the following shebang:
#!/bin/launchctl submit -l remount -- /sbin/mount -v -t hfs -o rw /dev/
disk0s1s1
 But wait! where's the mount point parameter?

Swiping through modern security features, HITB, AMS 2013
jeudi 11 avril 13

@evad3rs

EXECUTING LAUNCHCTL

 The icon tap will result in the app's path being appended as last parameter to the command line  Mount target is app `binary' at first, so mount fails initially
 To resolve this we just replace the DemoApp 'binary' with a symlink (using MB2):
/var/mobile/DemoApp.app/DemoApp -> /
 Since launchd restarts the job automatically the remount should succeed after a while

 dyld takes care of loading the dependent libraries in Mach-O.
 dyld also handles dlopen and other dynamic loading calls.
 dyld runs inside the process using it, so it has only the permissions every process has.  Conversely, every process has to be able to do what dyld can do.

CAN WE LOAD UNSIGNED DYLIBS?

 dyld tries to prevent this by requiring the Mach-O header of dylibs to be executable.

 ARM has a banked SPSR register that saves CPSR when an exception occurred.
 e.g. when a data abort occurs, current CPSR is saved to SPSRABRT before data abort handler is called.
 Of course, the instruction to read any of the SPSR registers is the same.

 Each `crash' leaks one object from kalloc.6144.  Do it too much and you'll panic.
 Caused by how IOConnectCall works.  Each call is actually a mach msg to the IOKit
server: MIG call to io_connect_method_*
 ipc_kobject_server is eventually called by mach_msg to dispatch it. It allocates a large ipc_kmsg for the error reply and saves the pointer on the stack.

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

 Wait for IOUSBDeviceClient driver to come up.

 Crash kernel once using call_indirect(data abort) and thread exception handling to get current boot's offset of stallPipe_1. Calculate KASLR offset.

 Load cached memmove offset or find memmove by reading default_pager() function (always first function in iOS XNU) and looking for memset. memmove is right above memset.

 Load other cached offsets or use memmove in more reliable read-anywhere primitive to dynamically find them.

 Get around kernel W^X by directly patching kernel hardware page tables to make patch targets in kernel text writable.
 Call kernel flush TLB function.  Requires kernel-read anywhere to walk tables.  Patch task_for_pid to enable task_for_pid
for PID 0 (kernel_task) to be called.
 Install shell code stub to syscall 0 to avoid using IOUSB again due to potential race conditions with kalloc'ed mach_msg OOL descriptors.
 Do rest of the patches using vm_write/vm_read calls. Use shell code stub to flush caches, etc.

 Clean up  Fix the kalloc leak from jumping to the
exception vectors.
 Stick around until USB device descriptors fully initialized.
 Due to sloppy programming of the driver, USB device descriptors must be configured before the first driver user client is shut down, or they can never be configured again.
