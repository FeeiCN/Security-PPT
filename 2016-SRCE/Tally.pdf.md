Challenges that Benefit from Message Fabric
 Enterprises will deploy components developed by vendors that may not have performed pairwise integration
 Vendor component capabilities will evolve independently over time
 Enterprises have diverse deployment topology and distribution requirements
 Sensor activity will occur at variable rates, with peaks, lulls

Implied SRCE Design Requirements
 Distributed, asynchronous message processing
 Permits faster message producers to proceed without waiting for slower consumers
 Allows message consumers to catch-up during the lulls
 Minimal coupling between message producers and consumers
 Rely only on common data representations and message bus interface
 Facilitate integration of components from independent vendors
 Backward compatibility of message formats
 Eliminate need for coordinated upgrades across components

Message Content
Sensor Actuator Interface
Sensors and actuators have translators and managers that bridge the proprietary interfaces (Raw Sensor Data) to the standard Control Message Infrastructure format (Cyber Events)

Messaging Attacks and SRCE

Attack Vectors

Example SRCE Outcome

Message Replay CoA enabled when not authorized, potentially

causing network disruption

Mitigation May Include
Signed messages with timestamp

Malformed Data (e.g. buffer overflow)

Response Controller could be affected by malformed data, allowing attacker undetected high privilege access

Whitelisting signed recipients, strong type/field checks

Man-in-the-Middle Message flooding

A malicious party may intercept sensor data and Mutual authentication

replace it with recorded sensor output that

appears normal, while actual abnormal sensor

data is inaccessible to SRCE

Critical third party services may be rendered Upstream high-speed dynamic

inaccessible if malicious party directs high

filtering, use of efficient signing

bandwidth resources appropriately

mechanisms (e.g., HMAC)

Spoofing

Malicious party receives sensitive analytics that Use of strong key management

can be used to develop stealth tactics

or strong CA capabilities

Passive Eavesdropping

Indicators and COAs for a particular attack are learned by an adversary leading to changes in the attack vector to bypass the described mitigations

Use of strong confidentiality mechanisms

Potentially Relevant Standards Efforts
 Message Transport
 Advanced Message Queueing Protocol (AMQP) from OASIS  Data Distribution Services (DDS) from Object Management Group
 Message Content
 Common Event Format (CEF) from HP ArcSight  Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) from MILE  Reporting Formats in Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)
from NIST  Open C2 from Open C2 Working Group
 Security
 DDS Security v1.0 Beta 1
 IETF Working Groups
 Security Automation and Continuous Monitoring (SACM)  Managed Incident Lightweight Exchange (MILE)  DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS)

Summary
 Interoperability requires standardized:
 Service definitions  Message content  Message transport  Content formats
 Connects the core services supporting Sensing, Sense Making, Decision Making, and Acting
 Can support centralized, decentralized, or hybrid orchestration models
Specifications are to be determined
