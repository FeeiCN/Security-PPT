Why

?

 FOSS
 Mission-built for Data Science
 Rich ecosystem for data analysis and visualization
 "Not Just R"  C/C++  Python  Rust  Go  Java  Scala  Wasm ...

{rmarkdown}
 Combine HTML, markdown, LaTeX and code (not just R code!) to create static or interactive reports.
 Can also work just like Jupyter Notebooks

R {shiny}
Create server-backed, highly dynamic reporting and data exploration applications that can be turned into standalone apps locally or served at scale on the internet.

What does the distribution of Tactics & Techniques look like? Where do we have technology gaps? Where do we have workforce gaps? Where should we invest our limited defense budget? How does X compare with Y? How does X compare with Y over time? What's the Dwell Time trend?

 fct_tactic: Make an ordered Tactics factor with optional better labelling  tactics_f: Tactics factors (generally for sorting & pretty-printing)
 validate_tactics: Validate Tactics strings against MITRE authoritative source  validate_technique_ids: Validate Technique IDs  validate_techniques: Validate Techniques strings against MITRE authoritative source
 attck_cdf_tactic: Product an ATT&CK Cumulative Distribution Function by Tactic  attck_map: Generate an ATT&CK heatmap  theme_enhance_atkmap: Remove cruft from ATT&CK heatmaps

What's Inside The Tin?
Validation Visualization

The following datasets are included:  enterprise_attack: Enterprise Attack Taxonomy v2.0  mobile_attack: Mobile Attack Taxonomy v2.0  pre_attack: Pre-Attack Taxonomy v2.0  tactics_f: Tactics factors (generally for sorting & pretty-printing)  tidy_attack: Combined ATT&CK Matrices Tactics, Techniques and Technique detail
