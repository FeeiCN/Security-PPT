3rd Platform Trends for 2015

Almost 50% of cloud security will
be delivered by the cloud to
protect the cloud

Big Data-driven threat intelligence
security will be 10 times more valuable
than traditional technologies

Mobile security includes identity, 2-factor
authentication, DLP, encryption, and mobile
payments

Cyber weapons becomes a growth business to the detriment of the security community

Social Controls combine security, marketing, and
Return on Investment

20% of security markets will shift from
protecting people and their devices to
"things" that have no users

Key Attributes for Successful 3rd Platform Security
 Design for common infrastructure, processes, technologies, products, and services that unite all four pillars of the 3rd platform
 Align business & security goals for a common POSTIVE outcome  Continually run discovery and vulnerability management against all assets  Regularly, test and update incident response processes  Monitor all users (e.g., employees, partners, suppliers, resellers,
customers, etc.) across all systems for anomalies, threats, and compliance  Remember that security is a continuous compromise between use cases,
shared risk, business requirements, user experience, and financial benefits across a broad spectrum of stakeholders  Migrate security strategies from reactive to proactive and predictive
