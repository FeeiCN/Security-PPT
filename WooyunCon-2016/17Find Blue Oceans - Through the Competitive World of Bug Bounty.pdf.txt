Find and Create Uncontested Bounty Targets
Give you some tips from my experience of Firefox bug bounty program

Tip #1
Find Bugs in Web Platforms
"Fox-keh" (C) 2006 Mozilla Japan

 Browsers and networking features in OS are less competitive targets  There are common pitfalls but not widely known  Developers make similar mistakes whenever they introduce new features

Learn Known Bugs from Security Advisories
and try the same attack scenario on similar features
Mozilla Foundation Security Advisories https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/

Example
Improper Handling of HTTP Redirect

browser
Request to victim

victim.server

evil.server

HTTP redirects

Location: evil Redirect to evil

Final response from evil

Developers expect following code properly gets a response only from victim
if( request.url.indexOf('http://victim.server/') === 0 ) {
resource = http.get(request.url); parse(resource); }

But still possible to load a resource from evil

if( request.url.indexOf('http://victim.server/') === 0 )

{

resource = http.get(request.url);

parse(resource); }

Resource from evil might be used due to redirect

Similar bugs were found other than Firefox

Firefox

 Bug 1111834 - Cross-origin restriction bypass in navigator.sendBeacon  Bug 1164397 - Origin confusion in cache data of Service Workers  Bug 1196740 - Cross-origin restriction bypass in Subresource Integrity (SRI)

Chrome  CVE-2015-6762 - Cross-origin restriction bypass in CSS Font Loading API

Safari

 CVE-2016-1782 - Non-http port banning bypass in WebKit

Tip #2
Find Bugs in Unstable Features
"Fox-keh" (C) 2006 Mozilla Japan

Firefox Nightly Builds https://nightly.mozilla.org/

Unstable Features in Dev. Builds are Eligible for Bounty
e.g., Firefox Nightly, Chrome Beta and Dev

Example
Subresource Integrity (SRI)

2015.08.13 SRI has been enabled in Nightly

2015.08.13 SRI has been enabled in Nightly

2015.08.20 Reported the first security bug in SRI
After 7 days

2016.01 - Implemented Service Workers on Firefox 44
Reported an origin confusion (Bug 1162018) on Nightly 41 at 2015.05
2016.08 - Planned to introduce Web Extensions on Firefox 48
Reported a privilege escalation (Bug 1227462) on Nightly 45 at 2015.11
2015.12 - Determined not to support HTML Imports on Firefox
Reported a sandbox bypass (Bug 1106713) on Nightly 37 at 2014.12

Tip #3
Find Bugs in Sub Products
"Fox-keh" (C) 2006 Mozilla Japan

New bland name is B2G OS

 Smartphones and Smart TV OS based on Firefox browser
 All applications are made with HTML5

All applications are made with HTML5

All applications are made with HTML5
Type <s>pwn

All applications are made with HTML5

Yes, we know

 Pre-installed applications run with higher privilege
 Protected with Content Security Policy (CSP) i.e. XSS doesn't work
 But HTML tag injection still works fine

Example
Special Iframe Tag Injection

Firefox OS supports special iframe that can embed another app in the frame
<iframe mozbrowser remote mozapp='app://fm.gaiamobile.org/manifest.webapp' src='app://fm.gaiamobile.org/index.html' /> Embed FM Radio app.

Inject special iframe
Type <iframe mozbrowser mozapp...>

FM Radio works

Finally reported 7 similar bugs and Received reward of $20,000+ from Mozilla

Firefox for Android

 Firefox for Android is also in scope of their bounty program
 There are many Android specific features and pitfalls e.g. improper intent handling

Example
UXSS in Intent URL Scheme

Intent scheme URL links let you launch another app from a web page
<a href='intent://maps.google.com/maps#Intent;scheme=http; package=com.google.android.apps.map; S.browser_fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmaps.google.com;end'>

Intent scheme URL link let you launch another app from a web page
Application name you want to launch <a href='intent://maps.google.com/maps#Intent;scheme=http; package=com.google.android.apps.map; S.browser_fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmaps.google.com;end'> Web site URL opened if application doesn't exist

Firefox unintentionally allowed to use any kinds of URL as a fallback
<a href='intent://maps.google.com/maps#Intent;scheme=http; package=com.google.android.apps.map; S.browser_fallback_url=javascript%3Aalert(1);end'>
JavaScript URL also does work

w = window.open( victim )
Attacker

Attacker

Victim

w.location = 'intent:...'
Attacker

Victim

Attacker

Specified JS runs on another origin
Victim

Firefox for iOS

 Firefox for iOS is eligible for a bounty but not officially announced
 Due to Apple's restriction, Firefox for iOS uses WKWebView for loading and rendering web contents
 Flaw in WKWebView is ineligible since it's out of control of Mozilla

Example
XSS in Browser Internal Page

Firefox for iOS distributes browser internal pages from local web server

Firefox for Desktop Firefox for iOS

about:home
http://localhost:6571 /about/home

about:license
http://localhost:6571 /about/license

about:sessionrestore
Feature of Firefox for restoring previous browsing session after crash

 Firefox for iOS hosts session restoration feature on http://localhost:6571/about/sessionrestore
 Restoring URL can be set by query parameter "history"

SessionRestore.html

"history" is parsed as JSON

and finally set to window.location
mozilla/firefox-ios/SessionRestore.html, Github https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-ios/blob/6ab27d75e0c3365b1decffff678072a9224f149f/Client/Assets/SessionRestore.html

Any page can trigger XSS on localhost
http://localhost:6571/about/sessionrestore? history= {"history":[" javascript:alert(document.domain) "]}
