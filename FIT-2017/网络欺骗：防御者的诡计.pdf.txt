 Deception technologies are defined by the use of deceit and/or feints designed to thwart or throw off an attacker's cognitive processes, disrupt an attacker's automation tools, delay an attacker's activities or disrupt breach progression. Deceptions are achieved through use of deceitful responses, purposeful obfuscations, feints, misdirections and other falsehoods.
