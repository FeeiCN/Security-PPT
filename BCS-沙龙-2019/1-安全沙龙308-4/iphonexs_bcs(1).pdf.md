Unix Domain Socket
 A UNIX socket is an inter-process communication mechanism that allows
bidirectional data exchange between processes running on the same machine.

int sock; struct sockaddr_un name; char buf[1024]; /* Create socket from which to read. */ sock = socket(AF_UNIX, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);
/* Create name. */ name.sun_family = AF_UNIX; strcpy(name.sun_path, "1.txt"); name.sun_len = strlen(name.sun_path);
/* Bind socket to the path. */ bind(sock, (struct sockaddr *)&name,
SUN_LEN(&name));
/* Read from the socket. */ read(sock, buf, 1024);

The race condition bug results in a UAF

UAF, let's look at the USE

UAF, let's look at the USE
fetch and call a function pointer through two deferences to a freed socket

UAF, let's look at the USE

fetch and call a function pointer through two deferences to a freed socket

save a return address to the freed socket

Binary version may be better

fetch and call a function pointer through two deferences to a freed socket

save a return address to the freed socket

The fix
 Fixed in iOS 12.2
 Still raceable, but adding extra checks to make sure two vnodes will only
keep one reference to the socket
 No public CVE
if(unp->unp_vnode==NULL){ vp->v_socket = unp->unp_socket; unp->unp_vnode = vp;
}

Take another look at unp_connect
First use of the freed socket
Note that we can safely return from socket_lock, if we avoid the function pointer call

Take another look at unp_connect

Exploit the race condition in unp_bind to construct two vnodes holding a dangling pointer, pointing to one of the sockets
