System Level

Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)

Proposed and implemented by Linux PaX project in 2001
Implemented in major OS systems, partially and completely
Can prevent code injection attack

Instruction Set Randomization (ISR)
ENCODING KEY XOR

An execution environment to prevent code injection
Reversible transformation between the processor and main memory
PROCESSOR



Moving Target Defense Research
System Level

Data Randomization

Randomize pointers (XOR pointer with random key)
Randomize memory data (XOR data with random masks)



Moving Target Defense Research
System Level

Compiler-based Randomization

Use compiler to generate multiple functionally equivalent, but internally different variants of a program



Moving Target Defense Research

Application Level

Diversify and randomize software using installer

Software installed through the special installer will be tagged with a random key
An execution environment will check and verify the random key
If the key is valid, the software is authorized to execute. Otherwise, software will not run



Moving Target Defense Research

Application Level

Diversify commands to prevent SQL injection attack, command injection attack, and cross-site scripting

SELECT id, name, description FROM products WHERE productid=$value
99999 OR 1=1
SELECT id, name, description FROM products WHERE productid=99999 OR 1=1



Moving Target Defense Research

Application Level

Diversify commands to prevent SQL injection attack, command injection attack, and cross-site scripting

Rewrites all keywords with arandom key appended
After taking user input, removes the random key by using regular expression check
If the check fails, the query will not be forwarded to database for execution

Application Level

Diversify commands to prevent SQL injection attack, command injection attack, and cross-site scripting

SELECT123 id, name, description FROM123 products WHERE123 productid=$value
99999 OR 1=1
SELECT123 id, name, description FROM123 products WHERE123 productid=99999 OR 1=1



Moving Target Defense Research

Network Level

Dynamic Resource Mapping System

Randomly change the location of the system where important resources are stored
A mapping system keeps track of the new locations



Moving Target Defense Research

Network Level

Random Host Mutation

Randomly change host IP address
