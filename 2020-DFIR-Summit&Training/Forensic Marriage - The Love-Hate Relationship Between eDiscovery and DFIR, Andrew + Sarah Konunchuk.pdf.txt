Myths about eDiscovery
 Button pushers  It's boring  Won't utilize all of the forensic
skill set  Not real forensics  Just data dumps  Very repetitive  Just dealing with legal  Only looking at data and not
doing investigative work  Have I mentioned it's boring?

Myths about DFIR
 You'll work in a SOC (Security Operations Center)
 Never see a full project start to finish
 Always looking at code to reverse engineer malware

What we love to hate about the other
"No one moves from DFIR to eDiscovery, but everyone moves from eDiscovery to DFIR."
