Engaging an IR Firm Scoping an Engagement Deploying the Engagement

Engaging an IR Firm

You might need an external IR firm if...

Your Incident Response Plan should guide you in determining when you need to ask for help. But when should that be?
 To confirm what you know  To determine what you don't know  If there is the potential for litigation  If you are going to invoke your cyber insurance
policy  To leverage someone else's expertise  To alleviate your tired analysts  To get written findings  To get someone your C-Suite will listen to  To learn to get better  You just need help

But who should I choose?
 Reputation (www.lmgtfy.com)

(Gartner, IDC, Forrester)  Previous partnerships  Infrastructure  Cost (Tech fees? Travel?)

One Time Engagement

Retainer

Pros  No commitment  One-time purchase  May work for those who have limited
funding

Pros  Guaranteed Service Level Objectives  Understanding of expectations
 Terms and conditions  Technology  Legal  Cyber Insurance  Opportunity to build relationships  Variety of service packages available (including proactive services)

Scoping the Engagement

First the Incident Overview
Detection
How was the incident discovered?

Actions
What has been done so far in response?

Impact
Current business and technology impact

People

Explain your capabilities

Process

Technology

 Information security team members
 Network team  System admins  Desktop support  Application specific
subject matter experts
 Disaster recovery  Legal team  PR/Communications

 Incident Response Plan  Crisis management
plan  Disaster recovery  Business continuity
plan

 Backup technology  Network detection
capability  Centralized logging  Endpoint security

Determine Your Objectives!
Root Cause? Data Exfiltration? Lateral Movement? Containment, Eradication & Recovery?

Determine Communications
Key Contacts - Is there a dedicated person coordinating Incident Response efforts?
Cadence - Daily updates? Open bridge?
Method - Out of band, Chat apps, Encrypted email, Secure Document Exchange

Determine Access
VPN Access, remote system, or other, and any credentials needed to access systems Security tool access (IDS, logs, endpoint security consoles) Access and Address of Facility, Best access airport and hotel Security badge, escort concerns and procedures Background check or security clearance needed

Legal Considerations
(Not a lawyer, Not Legal Advice)
 To help preserve privilege, it is recommended legal counsel be involved for any cyber related incident.
 If personal data is potentially involved or for internal investigations, it recommended that counsel engage directly with the IR firm.
 This may influence how communication occurs (e.g. all communications flow through counsel).

Preserve Privilege?
Check with your counsel, but consider...  How/through whom should
you communicate?  Internal/External Counsel?
 Written/Oral Communication?
 How should written communications be marked ?

Cyber Insurance
Proactively connect the insurer and the IR firm if possible, to ensure a smoother interaction if the time comes.

 Preferred vendors (pre-negotiated rates)
 Approval for non-preferred vendors
 When do you give no ce?
 How do you give no ce?
 What data needs to captured? (e.g., costs, expenses, labor)
 Policies generally only covers emergency related costs but could include:

 Data loss or destruction  Forensics  Loss of Income  Extortion Costs (Ransomware/DDOS)  No fica on Costs

 Privacy Regula on  Credit monitoring  Public Rela ons  Legal Costs  Crisis management

The Engagement

How long is this going to take?
It depends.

The quicker tools can be deployed, and evidence collected, the faster this can go; however:
 This is a marathon, not a sprint.
 Prepare your stakeholders that recovery can take time.
 While the goal is to get things up and running, rushing can mean mistakes or tipping off adversaries (and then you must start all over again)

Prepping for the (virtual) arrival..

Preservation of evidence
Segmenting affected systems if possible
Begin initial data collection

We have come for your evidence
An IR firm cannot determine what happened without evidence. The more data there is to look at, the better chance you have of getting answers.

 Collection through tool deployment  Access to SIEM and technology stack  Forensic image collection  Script deployment  File collection  Log collection

Tool Deployment
The tools deployed will vary by vendor; however, successful deployment for any relies on preparation.

 Know your assets. Who can identify critical/key systems?
 Know your network, especially ingress/egress points.
 What are your emergency change management requirements?
 Can you push agents/software (SCCM, etc.)?
 System requirements?
 Network requirements?

Logs, logs, logs

 Are logs forwarded into a centralized utility (e.g., SIEM)?
 Are logs stored locally?
 Are logs stored in the cloud? Can you access them?
 What is your data retention policy?
 Are you logging in UTC or local time?
 Are the logs time synchronized using NTP?

The Network
Know your current capabilities and your visibility gaps.

 Do you have a network assets list?  Do you have network diagrams?  Do you have packet capture
capabilities?  What network logs are you keeping?

 NetFlow (ingress and egress traffic, internal to internal traffic)
 DNS logs (query/transfer, client requests, answers/responses, zone transfers)
 DHCP logs (ability to map leased IP addresses and corresponding host names)

 Firewall logs  Network device logs
(routers, switches,
etc.)  IDS logs and alerts
(Internal and
Perimeter)  Proxy logs  VPN connections
(user, source and
destination IP, etc.)  Corporate Email
connections  Cloud connections

Endpoints and the Users
Know your current capabilities and your visibility gaps.

 Do you have an asset list for your Servers and Workstations?

 What OS and versions are your endpoints?

 Do you have any AV/EDR solutions? What is the coverage?

 Are there any remote access applications used in the environment?

 What type of logs are you collecting?

 Authentication (success and failures)
 Authorization changes
 Service (startup, shutdown, and status change)
 User account creation
 PowerShell  Changes to privilege

 Adding or deleting tokens
 Use of administrative privileges
 Access to regulated or confidential data
 Encryption key changes
 Creating or deleting system level objects
 Application events

Containment and Eradication
Something which should be determined at the onset of an engagement is if there will be hands on keyboards to facilitate containment and eradication or if another partner needs to be engaged.

 Can you do a password reset? Enterprise wide? Local? Service Accounts? Don't forget the golden ticket.
 What if your domain was compromised? How would you rebuild your DCs?
 Can you create isolated networks?
 Vulnerability/Patch management?
 Blocking at the perimeter?
 How are you communicating what is happening?

Recovery
Getting back to business is the goal, but it cannot happen until containment and eradication is done.

 Do you have backups? Are they secure? How far back can you go?
 Leverage Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery Plans if possible.
 Get plans in place for monitoring and long-term improvements.

Post-Incident Activities
Are we done yet?

 Do you have a process to remove deployed agents/software?
 Is there a need for evidence retention?
 Reports should guide you through the incident. Good reports should help you determine strategies to prevent the incident from happening again.
 Are you sharing your report with others? Consider privilege.
 Are you sharing your IOCs and experience with the security community?
