Network Threats : Malware, Exploits and C&C  Higher Variety
Dynamic Evolving Threats vs Static Threats
Malware, Exploits and C&C  Hard to keep up with fast evolving content and techniques  Rules do not scale  Needs fundamental innovation  Real Time Deep Learning scales
Protocol attacks, DOS, Network Scans  Evolve slowly and are very specific  Behavior based or static rule based detection  Reducing the sigs and rules helps improve performance

Can more technology improve DFIR?

Detection Phase

DFIR Phase

Network Endpoint Log Analytics
SOAR

Exfiltration
C2/Elevation Lateral
Movement Infection
Incursion
Few seconds

Rapidly Evolving Threat

Slowly Evolving Threat
Few Hours

 SOC Triad - NDR, EDR & SIEM  Different timescales & data lakes
 RCA & correlation hard  More suited for slowly evolving
threats that registers activity on various security controls  Rapidly evolving threat will circumvent the control triad.
 Solution: Stop threats at point of incursion using tightly correlated NDR & EDR

 Massive threat data exists  GPUs now available for processing  Enhancements in deep learning models

Evolving to Next-Gen AI - Real Time Deep Learning

 Deep Learning for Malware, Exploits and C&C detection
 Train using labeled samples  Classify unseen sample based on
learned characteristics  High generalization capacity  deals
with daily new variants  Low FP  blocking possible
 Behavior Analytics for Exfiltration, Recon and Post-Infection detection
 Rules only needed for small set of static attacks  better scaling with Gbps
