Observations on Adversary Infrastructure
When malicious actors register and host domains they leave behind data for us to analyze

What's in a Name?
Domain names can reveal intent

What's in a Name?
Domain names can reveal intent

TL;DR on TLDs / Registrars
Registration Costs Vary Wildly

TL;DR on TLDs / Registrars
Registrars can be indicators

Hosting Providers
When pivoting on hosting IPv4s, tenancy is key Multi Tenant Infrastructure
Shared / Managed Hosting / CDN / Domain Parking
Domains hosted on multi tenant IPs often have no relation to each other from an ownership perspective.

Hosting Providers
When pivoting on hosting IPv4s, tenancy is key Single Tenant Infrastructure
Virtual Private Servers + Dedicated Servers
Pivot on and monitor single tenant IPv4s

Name Servers
Most users stick with their hosting providers default name servers
Bad actors are no different, unless they need greater control over availability
Deviation from this can make for great pivots

Name Servers
Hosting Providers and their Name Servers can be overrun by malicious activity (perhaps by design?)
