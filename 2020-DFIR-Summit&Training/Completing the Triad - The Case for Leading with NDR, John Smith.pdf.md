Security Information and Event Management(SIEM)
TRIED AND TRUE
 Born from Syslog and rSyslog  Became very popular post
Sarbanes-Oxley  Has matured to become the focal
point in most CSIRT program
LIMITATIONS
 Limited to what is programmed to "log"
 Licensing can be costs can be prohibitive
 IOPS costs can be prohibitive  Requires configuration and/or
installation of forwarders  Can be "un-configured" or
"uninstalled"  Logs/Events can be deleted or
altered

Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
TRIED AND TRUE  Evolution from Antivirus to more
behavioral detections  Integration with Threat Intelligence
Systems  Provides process-level visibility  More kinetic version of "R" as it
will actually block malicious processes
LIMITATIONS  Like Syslogs, an agent needs to be
installed/configured  Rapid endpoint provisioning makes
ensuring deployment difficult  Is limited to "supported" operating
systems and will require patching and updating  Is often evaded/disabled by a crafty malware developer

What is NDR? (Network Detection and Response)

AND WHY DO I NEED IT?

 Wire/Network based Signal Intelligence

 Deployed using a SPAN/TAP to retrieve a

traffic mirror

 Unlike IDS/IPS, it uses behavioral analytics,

metadata and machine learning to inform on

observed anomalies, threats and breaches

 Does not require large-scale Agent

Implementation

 Does not require logging to be configured or

the deployment of forwarders

 Cannot be manipulated, uninstalled or un-

configured  Operates in a "Covert" position whereby
adversaries are NOT aware of its presence  Positions SOC/Threat Hunters to flank
adversaries who are unaware that they are being observed  Taps into Network Metadata presenting several thousand tuples

LIMITATIONS
 "R" is more API driven  Cannot directly act
against a bad actor  Data Fidelity (SPAN/TAP)  Cannot provide Process
Information (Hashes)

The Cybersecurity Triad (Key functions of all three solutions)

SYSLOG
 Collect Logs from agents and devices
 Writes them to disk  Extracts Context
 Mashup (CTI)  ML Interrogation  Querying Logs  Provides Investigation  Provides Detections and Alerts

Reveal(X) NDR
 Passively listens on the network  Evaluates metadata in
microseconds  Extracts Context in flight
 Mashup  Pre-Defined Criteria  API Calls  Extracts Context (ML)  Predictive Modeling  Group Clustering  Peer Grouping  Integrate with Sec Portfolio  SOAR  SIEM  EDR  REST API

EDR
 Installed on an operating system
 Leverages Cloud based Machine Learning
 Extracts Context  Behavioral ML  Threat Intelligence  Process/Hash Level Metrics
 Blocks and/or quarantines systems and processes

Denotes the need to install or configure agents/forwarders/logging

Example: Phishing URI and Payload

SYSLOG
 Host  Issuer  Subject  JA3  Cipher  Certificate Date
Information  ClientIP  ServerIP

Reveal(X) NDR
 Host  Issuer  Subject  JA3  Cipher  Certificate Date Information  ClientIP  ServerIP  Server Geo Location  SelfSigned (Y/N)  Threat Intelligence Match (Y/N)  *Does the Host Info match your
Namespace?  If decrypted will show Payload,
user-agent, content-type, etc

EDR
 Waits until Payload is Downloaded
 When the Process starts the information is sent to the Cloud
 Based on The Information the process is quarantined or allowed to continue

Denotes the need to install or configure agents/forwarders/logging

Using NDR and the SIEM (Better Together!)
NDR AUGMENTS YOUR SIEM
 Providing Visibility and Logging for IoT Devices  Can alert when logging has been shut off  Is still watching WHEN logging has been shut off  Makes metadata off the wire directly available for SIEM
integration  Sets Context in real-time vs. writing to disk, reading
from disk, THEN setting context
NDR IMPROVES YOUR SIEM
 Pre-Define Logging Conditions  Cert Issuer is LE and SNI matches your namespace  DNS Surveillance for malicious TLDs  Pull User IDs from decrypted Payloads and provide Geo-tracking of Teleworkers

Case Study (Making the SIEM Better: Malicious TLD Surveillance)
MONITOR MALICIOUS TLDS
 Customer wanted to monitor suspicious Top Level Domains
 Was using Splunk as the back end SIEM  During peak business DNS traffic was over 2000 EPS
CHALLENGES
 Monitoring DNS is noisy (over 2000 EPS)  Queries took a long time, even on hot storage  IOPS and Storage costs were very high  Deluge of records resulted in decreased efficacy of the
endeavor altogether

Making the SIEM Better: Enter Reveal(x) NDR
SOLUTION  Pre-Define Malicious TLDs  Send ONLY DNS records matching those conditions to
the SIEM  Added additional surveillance for namespace matching
the customers (Phishing attempts)

Making the SIEM Better: Enter Reveal(x) NDR
WITHOUT NDR
USING NDR  EPS went from 2000+ to less than 1 EPS  Massive savings in Licensing and IOPS costs  Added additional surveillance for namespace
matching the customers (Phishing attempts)  Increased Intelligence yield by several hundred
orders of magnitude

Using NDR and EDR (Better Together!)
NDR AUGMENTS YOUR EDR
 Providing Visibility into IoT Devices  Can use API to `shun' unmanaged devices  Can create a map of EDR Traffic by CIDR block to show
gaps in EDR coverage  Makes metadata off the wire directly available to Falcon,
Cloud based intelligence  Sets Context in real-time vs. writing to disk, reading from
disk, THEN setting context  Can leverage Threat Intelligence
NDR IMPROVES YOUR EDR
 Network based Detections can use API to quarantine systems
 Pre-Defined metadata can be sent to Falcon API or other Cloud based solutions
 Packet Metadata and PCAPs can be made readily available

Case Study (Making the EDR Better: Breach Response)
RYUK THROW DOWN!!!!
 Healthcare provider had been hit with RYUK ransomware  EDR Solution had been evaded and in many cases
disabled/removed  Cyber Response Team from Cyber Insurance Provider
responded  Endpoint-Driven Resolution was put into place
CHALLENGES
 There was a lack of visibility into which systems were infected
 The Response team ONLY had visibility into systems with deployed agents
 The Malware was using a very opaque SSL Channel to communicate
 VERY large gap in understanding the environment on the part of the 3rd party response team

Reveal(x) NDR Detections and Observations
DETECTIONS  Reveal(x) Detected Ransomware Activity  CIFS/SMB Brute Force and Enumeration  CIFS/SMB User Session Enumeration and High File Reads  PSEXEC Activity  POSH Remoting Activity
INVESTIGATIVE FINDINGS  Their Active Directory Domain namespace had been
externally registered by a nefarious registrar  IAM traffic was going to the external malicious IP  Emotet/Trickbot Infestation deploying the RYUK payload  Several "Orphaned HTTP Posts" to malicious external IPs

Investigative Findings (Continued)
Emotet/Trickbot Used to deploy the RYUK payload  VERY suspicious SSL Characteristics
 No HOST SNI, Cert Subject or Cert Issuer  Certificate was less than 48 hours old  Certificate was SELF SIGNED!!  Addresses, JA3s, etc were NOT on any blacklists
Noted Orphaned HTTP POSTS  No preceding GETs  Horrific payload data
 Usernames/Passwords  SSH Key information  VNC Information  OS Patch Level  Current Running Processes  EDR Client Info  Binary Payloads  OpenVPN Passwords  ALL sites with the strings (/auth|login|logon/i)

During the Response: (Working with EDR vendor)

Provide Visibility into what their current EDR coverage was

Painting Targets for Endpoint Detection and Response REVENGE!  Malware was copying a file called minirev.exe  All systems copying the file had EDR disabled  Provided EDR team a list of systems engaged in
copying the minirev.exe file  Provided EDR team a list of systems minirev.exe had
been copied to.

Conclusion: Apply what you have learned
LEAD WITH NDR  No agents/forwarders to install or configure  Only prerequisite is an IP Address (IoT, Unmanaged
Systems)  Several thousand sources of intelligence in Network
Metadata  Ultimate source of truth  Covert posture (adversary can't see you but you can see
them)
IMPROVE/AUGMENT SIEM  If it doesn't log....it does now (IoT,etc)  Higher Intelligence Yield  Higher Fidelity Messages
IMPROVE/AUGMENT EDR  Paint digital targets  Shun unmanaged devices  Cover for each other
 Find gaps in EDR coverage  Gives NDR a hammer to swing when we see
something
