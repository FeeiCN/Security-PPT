Stage 1- Research

 We need to know what we're concerned about before we can protect against it.
 This means reviewing your organization's tech stack and painting a picture of your vulnerabilities
 Dedicate time to research your attack vector and threat actors operating within it.

What's keeping your CISO up at night?
 Ransomware  Phishing  Web Application Attacks

Stage 1- Research

A little help from GRC
 If your organization is regulated, leverage your compliance documentation
 You've likely had to identify sensitive data, provide proof of security controls, create processes.
 Stay friendly with your compliance officer
 PCI DSS 10.x & 12.x

PCI requirements examples, because everyone loves PCI
 Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data
 Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters
 Protect stored cardholder data  Encrypt transmission of cardholder data
across open, public networks

You: Hey, nice to meet you it's my first
day. I'm the new security engineer. I was told to ping you, as I'd like an updated
network diagram.
Them: Sure, here you go and welcome.

You: Excuse me but the date on this
diagram is three years old. Do you have
something from this year?

Threat Modeling
Useful but lacks definition Helpful during an incident but not so
much for our goals Lets go a bit deeper
 Somewhat better  Positioned not only for layer3 reference but OS details. **It
will come in handy later  We're in security and need more relevant data  Take note of the flow of data

Yowl! A restaurant review site that really shouldn't be in prod yet. Allows you to register a user, add reviews, and search existing reviews.
Based on our threat model ...
 What do we actually care about?
 What would need to be fixed to actually solve the problem?
 Ho14w would we fix it?

Does This Happen?
 Sort of.  Actual vulnerabilities, not simulated.  Doesn't use modern frameworks or
client side processing.
 Super small app  Super vulnerable  It intends to be an image upload  Does it stop you from uploading
something else?

What's wrong with it?

?

And how do we find that out?  Static Analysis  Dynamic Analysis  Code Review  Manual testing

First, static findings

Next, dynamic
Not everything found by static is easily exploitable, and sometimes what's wrong with your app isn't visible in the code

Stage 2 Creating The Attack

Victim VM

#OPSEC
 Stage 1-Local File Inclusion vulnerability running on Apache client for an organization. Upload payload
 Stage 2- Navigate to payload directory to leverage system calls for further exploitation. In our case, uploading backdoor. YAY
 Stage 3- Upload backdoor. Circumvent defensive tools
19  Stage 4- Exfil of data

#OPSEC- Identify
 What do we have here?  Vulnerable PHP  Does it stop you from uploading
something else?

Can We Get In
21

 Web server accepted the payload  Time to grab hashes and
dump'em  Move to exfil, then leave  Simple.

#OPSEC-Persistence

 Oh they're tricky and reboots don't always work

 So what can attackers rely upon to maintain access and not raise suspicious
 Check cron jobs

Internal Pupy call to hide process and ports

#OPSEC-Migration
 Attacker methods to blend in  Odd cron jobs  Process hi-jacking  DLL Sideloading  Out of place powershell scripts

 Hint: Don't trust the times2t3amps

Stage 3 Create & Deploy Detection

Hunt w/DeTT&CT
 How do we map our hypothesis to our to controls and procedures  If you can't prove it, it doesn't exist
 Except aliens. They are real  Circling back to why we started  At this stage you'll need a few things
 Logs sources  Machine hostnames & ip address  EDR, IDS, SIEM information

Define Data Sources w/ DeTTACT
 Start slow and build  Only name relevant data  Maintain consistency
across the org  Verify with IT

Attribute to Security Program
 After you've completed this cycle and created your threat cards, you'll need to consider how to leverage them
 Your use case is primarily driven by detection  How can we prove this?  Where does it count?
 After you've proven your use case, begin to think about metrics
