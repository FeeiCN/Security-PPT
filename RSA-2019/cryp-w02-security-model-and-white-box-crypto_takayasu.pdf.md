Summary of Our Result
In this talk, we show tight equivalences between the DL and several DiffieHellman variants in the algebraic group model defined in [FKL@Crypto'18]. The results imply information theoretic lower bounds for solving the Diffie-Hellman variants in the generic group model. The most advantage is that we obtain the results through very very very simple techniques.

 A number of DL algorithms have been proposed;  sub-exponential algorithms (e.g., NFS) working in specific groups,  ( ) time algorithms working in any cyclic groups.
 The latter is called generic algorithms, where ( ) times group operations is proved to be an information theoretic lower bound [Shoup@EC'97].

 We should try to study computational complexities of these problems. If possible, we want to

make computational reductions from the DL to these problems although it seems infeasible in

the standard computational models...

Our Results
We successfully provide tight reductions from the DL to the CDH, k-EDH, k-PDH, k-linear, BDH. We formalize master theorems to indicate when our technique is applicable. The tightness is not an advantage but a limitation of our results. We continue the research for the Matrix CDH and the kernel Matrix DH.

Conclusion
We provided tight reductions from the DL to several variants of Diffie-Hellman problems in the AGM defined by [FKL@Crypto'18].
We define the AGM in symmetric bilinear groups by following [FKL@Crypto'18]'s definition in cyclic groups. We formalized master theorems to indicate the Diffie-Hellman variants that can be reduced to from the DL by following our approach. Our master theorem does not include the k-linear problem. Therefore, we provided an tailormade reduction for the k-linear problem.
As future works, we try to study the Matrix CDH and the Kernel Matrix DH. Other interesting future works are analogous results in composite-order groups, decision problems, or non-tight reductions.
