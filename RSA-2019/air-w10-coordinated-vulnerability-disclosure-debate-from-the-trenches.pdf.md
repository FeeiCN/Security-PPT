Founder & CTO @ HackerOne

"The" CERT Coordination Center (at the SEI, an FFRDC at CMU)

Following a passion to open lines of communication between Hackers Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure since 1988 (2001 personally)

and Enterprises.

"Don't use IE" and "Replace CPU hardware"

HackerOne has enabled 1,300 organizations to coordinate the disclosure

and resolution of over 100,000 valid vulnerabilities discovered by the the CVD standards, policy, normalization in ISO, FIRST, CVE, OASIS, other

hacker community.

places, also care about vulnerability data and information systems,

prioritization and risk, supply chain transparency and relationships

Past Life: Led Product Security @ Facebook; Security Research @

(SBOM!)

Forcepoint; Security @ State of FL; Has authored an unforgiveable amount of vulnerable software

My team studies exploits, the vulnerability ecosystem, develops fuzzing (BFF) and other vulnerability discovery tools

Theory...
A good Samaritan finds a vulnerability
Quietly notifies the vendor
Vendor promptly creates fix and pushes to end users

#RSAC
Spectre & Meltdown
Several discoverers (+ varying motives)
 Google Project Zero + me + academics...
Many vendors + vendor types
 CPU makers, chipmakers, O/S vendors, device makers, virtualization systems, cloud hosting, browsers, compilers, drivers, libraries...
 Other stakeholders: Gov't, major users, press...
Who coordinates... & decides who is 0-day'd?
 Discoverers, vendor(s), a 3rd party...
What if no clean, rapid fix?
 In-field mitigations may be partial or impossible  Vendors may fear liability, PR, internal blame...  Fixes can be slow to develop, percolate supply chain

Many bugs are uncomplicated,

#RSAC

but Spectre messiness is not unique

Differential Power Analysis WiFi/RC4 issues (KRACK...) Heartbleed Dual-EC DRBG Glibc vulnerabilities (getaddrinfo...) RowHammer DNS cache poisoning aka Kaminsky Bug Vendor-complicit privacy leaks
...

Vulnerabilities in components, standards, or common practices
Conflicting incentives or expectations
