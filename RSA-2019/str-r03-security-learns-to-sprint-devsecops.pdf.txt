Introduction: Application Security

Poor AppSec is a Problem!
Poor AppSec Causes 2940%~ of Breaches!

@SheHacksPurple

#RSAC
Application Security Missing!
AppSec is not covered in most post-secondary Comp-Sci and Soft-Eng programs
And when it is, it's often an after thought.

Waterfall Never Worked Well
And the accompanying security model was much, much worse.

DevOps
The Main Goals

#RSAC
Improved Deployment Frequency
Security emergencies can be fixed NOW.
@SheHacksPurple

#RSAC
Lower Failure Rates
Resiliency

Lower Failure Rates

Resiliency

Confidentiality
= Integrity Availability

#RSAC
Faster Time to Market
Security doesn't win if the business doesn't also win.

What does this mean for Dev & Ops?
The "Photo" Slide, #1
· Assisting in tuning SAST and DAST tools · Reusing known good code · Using up-to-date images · Using the Security Pipeline · Making negative unit tests · Severe security bugs break the build · We cannot do it without them on board
@SheHacksPurple https://aka.ms/learn-to-sprint-RSA

#RSAC
What does this mean for Security?
Ensure Dev and Ops are not waiting on you.
We CANNOT be a bottleneck.
Make processes that WORK.

The "Photo" Slide, #2
· Ensure Dev & Ops are not waiting on you · Tuning security tools so they do not produce
false positives · Breaking security activities into smaller pieces
so that they fit into the "sprints" · Make processes that work , and match pace · Providing secure templates and code samples
that a known-secure (sec code library)
@SheHacksPurple https://aka.ms/learn-to-sprint-RSA

#RSAC
What does this mean for Security?
Create a parallel security pipeline.

What does this mean for Security?
Write your own code libraries, for your business' specific needs.

What does this mean for Security?
The "Photo" Slide, #3
· Create a security pipeline · Buy licenses for dev and ops for sec tools · This does not mean doing 100% of the work
yourself, it means making it possible for Dev & Ops to perform security as part of their daily work. · Writing your own tools and libraries, see RepoKid from Netflix · Enable Dev and Ops, in every way you can.

What does this mean for dev & ops?
Providing feedback to the security team about what they are concerned about.
The security team listening and taking action.
Participating in security activities.

The "Photo" Slide, #4
· Automate as much as humanly possible, then teach dev and ops to understand the results
· Tune the tools, so they don't waste anyone's time · Add security into each phrase of the SDLC, including
requirements and design · Insist that the build breaks if a large security
vulnerability is introduced, security is a part of quality · Rename functions you want to phase out · Check out Netflix's RepoKid!
@SheHacksPurple

#RSAC
What does this mean for Security?
Positive testing determines that your application works as expected. If an error is encountered during positive testing, the test fails.
Negative testing ensures that your application can gracefully handle invalid input or unexpected user behavior.

The "Photo" Slide, #5
· If a PenTest is done, check all apps for those vulns · Use tools like OWASP DefectDojo to provide feedback on
metrics and trends to Dev & Ops · Invite Dev & Ops to participate in Security activities, for
feedback and teaching · Don't be afraid to try new things and get creative, writing
your own tools likely is to provide your best results. · Add negative use cases as unit tests, not just positive use

· Offer security training to Dev & Ops. Pay for it. · Share information widely when you fix or find new
security issues, · Run Security Exercises or Incident Simulations · Provide and analyze metrics from security testing,
look for patterns or systemic issues · Checkout Netflix Chaos Monkey · Never forget that your focus is to enable Dev and Ops
to get their jobs done, securely.

#RSAC
Apply What You Have Learned Today
Next week you should:
­ Add security verification to CI/CD Pipelines ­ Critical security bugs break the build
In the first three months following this presentation you should:
­ Create Negative Unit Tests from existing positive unit tests ­ Lessons on top 3 security bugs ­ High security bugs break the build
Within six months you should:
­ Regular lessons on AppSec, including a security exercise or simulation ­ Improvements of security processes for speed and removal of obstacles ­ Creation of parallel security pipeline ­ Medium security bugs break the build
