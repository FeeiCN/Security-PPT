Our Teen Advisers Describe the Challenges

#RSAC
The Importance of Being Liked
"likes", "loves", "comments", and followers counts have become a barometer for popularity

#RSAC
Peer Validation and the "Pull" of Social Media
Teens care deeply about peer validation. Feedback on social media, positive and negative, is hard to resist.
Brains are hard wired to seek new information. We get a shot of dopamine with each new text, tweet, "like". Dopamine is stimulated by unpredictability, small bits of information and reward. The very things we get on social media.

Is it opening up their world, or closing it down?
Behavior gets in the way of responsibilities
Used as an escape or selfmedication
Keep doing it even after it stops being fun
Can't stop even when they try Keep going in spite of negative consequences

#RSAC
From Unconscious to Conscious Looping
What did you notice about your loop? What are you constantly checking? What stays on in the background? Do you check more after a post? Is there an emotion attached to it?
Are you ever free of your loop?
