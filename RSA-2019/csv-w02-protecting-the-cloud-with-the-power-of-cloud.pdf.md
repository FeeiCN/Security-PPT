What are we going to talk about...?
DevSecOps - How we "SaaS-ified" our on-prem security tools with Docker and DevSecOps - Scaling security with help of Cloud enables Security automation.
Self-healing Cloud Misconfigurations - How native Cloud based tooling helps reduce risk - How Automation and Self-healing works in our Cloud environment
Open Source Technologies : [Takeaway] -- start your DevSecOps journey from Day 1 - Dow Jones Hammer: Open source tools enables security - Project Bravos : Embedding security into Build Pipeline

#RSAC
Quick Flashback....
- Traditional Security tools - Manual Reviews - Lack of visibility and scalability

DevSecOps
Solve a specific problem in an automated manner with well defined People, Process, Technology actions and extensive, actionable reporting

#RSAC
Setting priorities right...
Risk vs Reward End Goal: Reduce Risk

Dow Jones Hammer
Open Sourced : https://github.com/dowjones/hammer

Hammer... why?
 "Auto-fix" misconfigurations with ability to rollback  Cloud Infrastructure visibility  Easily pinpoint MY product's security issues  Tailored reporting, save analysis time  API driven approach

#RSAC

Our Solution
 Automate  Scalable  Self-service  Auditable

Multi-account sprawl
 Lack of visibility  Scalability  "Someone is looking into it..."

#RSAC
Multi-account growth : Ideal State

Hammer: What Does it Solve?
Public Instances with Admin IAM Policies Exposed EC2 Instances Docker on EC2 ECS
Exposed RDS instances Unencrypted RDS Public RDS Snapshots

#RSAC
Public S3 buckets Unencrypted S3 buckets Public S3 bucket Policy
Unused IAM Keys Stale IAM Keys (not rotated)
