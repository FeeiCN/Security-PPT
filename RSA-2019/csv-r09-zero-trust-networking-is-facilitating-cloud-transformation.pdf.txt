Three Questions to Determine Where You Are in #RSAC Your Cloud Journey
Do you use Software as a Service? (Salesforce,Workday, Net Suite?) Have you transitioned to Office 365? Do you use MPLS and hub-andspoke?

Application Transformation
The cloud is the new corporate data center

#RSAC
Applications are moving to the cloud
4

#RSAC
The Three Stages of Application Transformation
Stage 1. Software as a Service
Advantages:
 Low to zero development cost  No software license  No server configuration or management  Easy deployment  Lower Total Cost of Ownership

The Three Stages of Application Transformation

Stage 2. Refactoring
 Lift&Shift: Simply host apps that are already web-enable in the cloud.
 Partial Refactoring: Move the front end to the cloud. Leave the data in the data center.
 Refactoring: Rewrite for the cloud.

Stage 3. Cloud-first
Cloud deployment is considered first.  Will it be better?  Will it be cheaper?  Will it be more secure?
8

#RSAC
Do these things
Audit and take stock of all your applications Prioritize and schedule them for:
Lift & Shift Partial Refactoring Full Refactoring
Be prepared for the impact on your network!

Network Transformation
The internet is the new corporate network

#RSAC
Moving to the cloud introduces network bottlenecks
11

#RSAC
Office 365: The Killer App
Meaning, it will kill your network
It's always on.  Everyone is using it.  Synching to OneDrive can be
disastrous  Watch out for DNS hair pinning
12

#RSAC
Hub-and-Spoke has to go
A 40 Year Old Architecture.
13

#RSAC
IF ALL YOUR TRAFFIC GOES TO CLOUD APPS
WHY ARE YOU BACKHAULING?
Local internet breakout:
 Cheaper  Faster  Easier to deploy  Supported by SDN
14

#RSAC
Where does you security stack go?
Answer: It goes away
No data center? No stack.
What about at each of the remote offices? What about UTM?
A major market segment is at risk here.
15

#RSAC
Do this
Replace MPLS backhaul with (redundant) local internet breakout Use cost savings to fund digital transformation Use Microsoft Express Route or...
16

Zero-Trust Networking
A new security architecture

#RSAC
What cloud transformation looks like
18

Zero-Trust
Applications do not broadcast their location by IP address.
Only authenticated users can connect to the apps/resources.
Two paths:
1. Go with a service (the cloud way) 2. Build your own

#RSAC
Stealth fighter Can't be pinged with radar

19

#RSAC
Do this
Get identity right.
Consolidate directories in the cloud. (Azure AD, Okta, Ping...)
Cloud policy engine
Granular policies per user per app
Do the security. Multi-Tenant tech for AV, sandboxing, URL content filtering, etc., etc., etc. Use cloud DNS Log only events, not content (GDPR)
