1. How Do You Breathe?

#RSAC
Benefits of Diaphragmatic Breathing
Slows your heart rate and calms you physically. Provides oxygen to your brain. Aids your stance and appearance, avoiding a "caved in" look. Creates the sound of authority. Supports sound to the end of the sentence, where the important words come. You appear confident and in control (rather than gasping for breath).

Breathing Techniques

1. Exhale all air from your lungs. 2. Continue pushing it out even after you
feel it's totally expelled. 3. When no more air can be forced out,
you will automatically inhale. 4. Inhale deeply. 5. Observe how the air rushes in. 6. Only a deep, full inhalation will satisfy
your hunger for air. 7. Repeat this process frequently, but not
more than three or four times at each repetition.

1. Exhale comfortably. 2. Take a moderately filling breath, not
crowding your capacity. 3. Hold it for 15 seconds, then exhale
quietly. 4. Repeat this process frequently for
several days. 5. Gradually increase your holding time
to 20 seconds, 30 seconds, and 45 seconds. 6. Eventually, you will be able to hold your breath for a full minute.

Six Steps to Relax Your Voice
 Place your hands lightly on your throat muscles and speak in a normal tone. Note the tenseness of the throat muscles and the tightness of your jaw.
 Yawn. Open your mouth wide. Finish the yawn with an easy "ho-hum," prolonging the "hum" for several seconds. Drop your jaw as far as it will go without stress. Waggle the jaw from side to side and continue humming with your lips closed and jaw loose.
 Repeat the yawning and humming. Notice how your throat muscles have loosened and become relaxed. See how comfortable your throat feels with the strain removed.
 Retaining this feeling of ease and looseness, say the following words: hang, harm, lane, main, lone, loom. Open your mouth wide, dropping your jaw loosely. Exaggerate your lip and jaw movements. When your throat feels tired, stop and yawn again.
 Lightly knead the throat muscles with your fingers to eliminate tightness.
