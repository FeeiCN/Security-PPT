#RSAC
An inclusive person participating in the movement of security
into devops.
@devsecops @wickett

#RSAC
...not a tool ...not a security CI/CD pipeline ...not a CI/CD pipeline with security in it ...can't be bought on expo floor

#RSAC
The 10-fold Path of DevSecOps
@devsecops @wickett

#RSAC
The Journey
1. See the new world 2. Recognize place in value chain 3. Know Agile and DevOps 4. Live out Bi-directional Empathy 5. Do Security for Developers' Benefit 6. Operationalize DevSecOps 7. Make Security as Normal 8. Track Adversary Interest 9. Create Security Observability 10. Build the Future

1.See the New World
@devsecops @wickett

#RSAC
@devsecops @wickett

#RSAC
3 Major Movements 1. Waterfall -> Agile -> DevOps 2. Monolith -> Microservices
3. Datacenter -> Cloud
@devsecops @wickett

#RSAC
The Developer Revolt is Real
@devsecops @wickett

#RSAC
While engineering teams are busy deploying leading-edge technologies, security teams are still
focused on fighting yesterday's battles. - SANS 2018 DevSecOps Survey
@devsecops @wickett

#RSAC
Companies are spending a great deal on security, but we
read of massive computerrelated attacks. Clearly
something is wrong. The root of the problem is twofold: we're protecting the wrong things, and we're hurting productivity
in the process.
@devsecops @wickett

#RSAC
[Security by risk assessment] introduces a dangerous fallacy: that structured inadequacy is almost as good as adequacy and that underfunded security efforts plus risk management are about as good as properly funded security work
@devsecops @wickett

#RSAC
Meanwhile, Devs be like...
@devsecops @wickett

#RSAC
Don't get run over...

Security Hierarchy of Needs
Authentication
Focus on securing access through identity verification and two-factor authentication 4
mechanisms to establish trusted usage
Asset Management
Maintain a manifest of all components, 2 configurations and attribution data to ensure proper asset handling, lifecycle management
and to speed up response events

#RSAC

Encryption
Prevent data loss by leveraging the 5 benefits of encryption for selectively
eliminating injection attacks and transparently protecting access to data

Logging

3

Implement event logging and audit trails to ensure visibility, detection and response

for abuse cases

Zoning & Containment

1

Establish trust boundaries and control blast radius to ensure workload safety,

viability and resiliency

@devsecops @wickett

#RSAC
2. Recognize Place in the Value Chain

3. Know Agile and DevOps

#RSAC
Continuous Delivery is how little you can deploy at a time

#RSAC

#RSAC
We optimized for cycle time--the time from
code commit to production
@devsecops @wickett

#RSAC
Roughly 15,000 deploys in the last 3.5 yrs
@devsecops @wickett

#RSAC

#RSAC
You might be, if...
 Security is writing code and identify with developers  You have completed value stream mapping and/or
wardley map  You have started logging for security feedback within
your CI/CD Pipeline  Read The Phoenix Project
@devsecops @wickett

Are you ready to advance?

#RSAC
4. Live out Bi-directional Empathy
@devsecops @wickett

#RSAC
Culture is the most important aspect to devops succeeding in
the enterprise
- Patrick DeBois
@devsecops @wickett

#RSAC
A security team who embraces openness about what it does
and why, spreads understanding.
- Rich Smith

You cannot train developers to write
secure code.

#RSAC
460,046 Lines of Code @devsecops @wickett

#RSAC
The goal should be to come up with a set of automated tests that probe and check security configurations and runtime system behavior for security features that will execute every time the system is built and every time it is deployed.

#RSAC
Realign on Separation of Duties
@devsecops @wickett

#RSAC
[Deploys] can be treated as standard or routine changes that have been pre-approved by management, and that don't require a heavyweight change review meeting.
