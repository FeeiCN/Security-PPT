And that's not all...
Too many tools
Analysts are wasting time logging into multiple tools to cross check data and investigate.
Events lack context
Users are unable to grasp the big picture of an event easily and have challenges with event handoff.
Difficulty tracking event lifecycle
Users want visibility into full alert/event/case lifecycle in a single tool.

#RSAC
Escalating to ticketing systems is arduous
Users cannot easily escalate to ticketing systems, causing a lot of manual copying and pasting or "hacky" solutions that may surface sensitive data.
Baby steps towards automation
SOCs are heavily prioritizing orchestration and automation, but taking baby steps.
Lack of process
SOCs acknowledge they need to continue to develop out and mature their processes. There is still a long way to go.
