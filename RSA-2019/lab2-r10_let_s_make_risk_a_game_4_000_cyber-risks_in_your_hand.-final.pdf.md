Risk Ownership

Risk Oversight

Operational management
 Day-to-day tempo
 Provide strategy for controls
 Identify, assess, control, and mitigate risks
 Security is designed into the systems

Work closely with first line
 Support mgmt policies, define roles and responsibilities, and set goals for implementation
 Provide risk management frameworks
 Identify known & emerging issues
 Identify shifts implicit risk appetite
 Assist mgmt in developing processes and controls to manage risks and issues

What are you willing to risk?

Risk is not a game of "Whack-A-Mole"

#RSAC

BlackHat 2016

It is a game of "What if?"

#RSAC

What's the worst that could happen?
"Fight every battle everywhere, always in your mind...Every possible series of events is happening all at once. Live that way and nothing will surprise you. Everything that happens will be something that you've seen before."

Oh no. Someone alert the SOC!

#RSAC
From your case study
Use the cards to model out 2-4 scenarios that look like what happened in the case study (from the writeup or your own research.) Capture them at your table Decide on an impact (make it up. How many different ways could you determine it?) Use blank cards to create any objects you need

On Impact
"How badly could it hurt us?" "How much is too much?"

#RSAC
Business Impact & Risk Acceptance
High Acceptance: Scenarios that are the cost of doing business.
Acceptance Drops: Scenarios that are bearable but not preferable.
Very Low Acceptance: Scenarios that present hardship to the business.
No-Acceptance: Scenarios are existential threat to the business.
