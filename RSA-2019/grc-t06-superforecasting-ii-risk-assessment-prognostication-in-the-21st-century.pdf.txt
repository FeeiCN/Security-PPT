Heat Maps are Poor Vehicles for Conveying Risk
2005: Surveyed NATO Officers believe that Highly Likely could mean anywhere between 40% and 100% likely. Heuer
2006: Studies find that experts choose "1" more often in a scale of say "1" to "10" regardless of the subject matter the number is supposed to represent. - Rottenstreich
2008: Ordinal scales inadvertently create range compression; a kind of extreme rounding error. - Cox
2009: Surveyed students and faculty believe that "Very Likely" could mean anywhere between 43% and 99% likely. - Budescu
2016: Cybersecurity scoring systems like OWASP (Open Web Access Security Project), CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System), CWSS (Common Weakness Scoring System), and the CCSS (Common Configuration Scoring System) perform improper math on non-mathematical objects to aggregate a risk score. - Hubbard/Seirsen
2016: The idea of "Risk Tolerance" is not presented. Just because risk officers rate an event as highly likely does not mean that leadership is not willing to accept that risk. - Hubbard/Seirsen
2016: Heat maps convey no information about when the event might happen (next year, next three years, next decade.) - Hubbard/Seirsen
2016: Some risk officers rate events as more likely just because they could be more impactful. - Hubbard/Seirsen
2016: When percentages were explicitly defined, highly likely is between 90% and 99% for example, survey participants violated the rules over half the time. - Hubbard/Seirsen
2016: Most surveyed experts using ordinal scales from "1" to "5" chose the values of "3" or "4" reducing the 5X5 matrix to a 2X2 matrix. - Hubbard/Seirsen

Mitigation might change the Probability of the Risk Occurring

The event is more/less likely to occur

P(Risk Creates Impact)

Mitigations to Employ

Mitigation may change the resulting cost if it occurs
Cost of Impact
158

The Mitigations will Cost $$$$

Building a curve for Loss Exceedance

#RSAC

1: Identify your organization's Risk Register Items. mitigations.

2: Assess the probability of occurrence/impact for each Item with mitigations.

3: Assess the probability of various loss levels given the Item occurs+ mitigations.

4: Calculate the posterior probability loss distribution for each item.

5: Convert the previous to a cumulative distribution function (CDF) of loss.

6: Repeat 2-5 for every Risk Register Item.

7: Sample the CDFs to generate sample losses.

8: Add each of the Item's sampled losses => total loss for the sample.

9: Repeat 7-8 a couple 100,000's times (this is Monte Carlo sampling!)

10: Convert the count of each sample value into probability and plot.
