Building your own pathway forward:

#RSAC
Things You Can Do:
Dedicate time for self: times for fun, hobbies, activities not related to work. Taking moments for self reflection: taking a walk, journaling, mindfulness. Keeping open communication with people you trust, and look out for each other. Learning about mental health, and to get help and care when needed. Driving cultural change through leadership emphasizing mental health as a key priority.
Having people from different fields and backgrounds to come together and learn from one another.
32

#RSAC
Apply to Action
After this session:  Think about your own mental T-R-A-Y, and how you can use it.  Meet 3 new people at the RSA Conference with whom you can start a conversation
about mental health. Next week:  Create a mental stress inventory of yourself, and of your organization. Identify what
is working well, and what is not. Make a pledge to be better. In 3 months:  Work on your personal prioritized inventory list. Track progress.  Find a colleague who shares enthusiasm for mental health at the workplace, and co-
organize an event where people feel safe to chat and share.
