#RSAC
Why Measure ICS Threat Maturity?
Approximate the maturity of ICS threats compared to the "worst" case
Limited defender resources
"Bad" vs "Boom"
Threat behavior proliferation
Forecast large-scale infrastructure cybersecurity risk

#RSAC
Growth in ICS Threats and Maturity

1998 - 2009
Lack of Collection - Campaigns: APT1 - ICS Malware: None

2010 - 2012

2015-2017
Adversaries Disrupt ICS

- Campaigns: 10 Unique

- ICS Malware: CRASHOVERRIDE

2013 - 2015

and TRISIS - First and second ever electric

grid attacks that disrupt power

- First malware to target human

life

New Interest in ICS

Campaigns Target ICS

- Campaigns: Sandworm - Campaigns: Dragonfly

- ICS Malware: Stuxnet - ICS Malware: BlackEnergy 2 and Havex

- First attack to cause physical destruction on

civilian infrastructure (German Steel)

Why Does This Matter? What Can We Do With This?
Project activity maturation timelines Align defensive priorities to the threat environment Separate "bad" from "boom" Define the global ICS risk environment Measure changes in proliferation
