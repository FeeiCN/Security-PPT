Security Hierarchy of Needs
Authentication
Focus on securing access through identity verification and two-factor 4 authentication mechanisms to establish
trusted usage
Asset Management
Maintain a manifest of all components, 2 configurations and attribution data to ensure proper asset handling, lifecycle management
and to speed up response events

#RSAC
Encryption
Prevent data loss by leveraging the 5 benefits of encryption for selectively
eliminating injection attacks and transparently protecting access to data
Logging
Implement event logging and audit trails 3 to ensure visibility, detection and
response for abuse cases
Zoning & Containment
Establish trust boundaries and control 1 blast radius to ensure workload safety,
viability and resiliency
