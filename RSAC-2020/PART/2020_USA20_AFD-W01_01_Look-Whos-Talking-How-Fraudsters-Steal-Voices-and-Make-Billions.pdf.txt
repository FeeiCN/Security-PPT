The Rise of Deepfake Content
AI-Manipulated Audio & Video Deepfakes first entered the public eye late 2017, when an anonymous Redditor under the name "deepfakes" began uploading videos of celebrities into adult content using a tool to insert faces into footage frame by frame. Today, advances in artificial intelligence and neural networks can produce audio and visuals with quality that begins to rival that of human perception.

ATTACKS - THREAT TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR
August 30th, 2019: Criminals used AI-based software to impersonate a chief executive's voice and demand a fraudulent transfer of 220,000 ($243,000). The CEO of a U.K.-based energy firm thought he was speaking on the phone with his boss, the chief executive of the firm's German parent company, who asked him to send the funds to a Hungarian supplier.
July 19th, 2019: BBC reported on three successful audio attacks on private companies. In each, a company's "CEO" called a senior financial officer to request an urgent money transfer. Millions of dollars were stolen from each company, whose names were not revealed.
June 11th, 2019: A fake video of Mark Zuckerberg giving a sinister speech about the power of Facebook has been posted to Instagram. The company previously said it would not remove this type of video.
