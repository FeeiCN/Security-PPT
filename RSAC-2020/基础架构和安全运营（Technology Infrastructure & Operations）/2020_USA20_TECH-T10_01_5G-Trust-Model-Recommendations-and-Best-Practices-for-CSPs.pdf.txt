Security landscape is changing

Today
Mostly bare metal networks, with security measures primarily based upon
и 3GPP defined mechanisms и Perimeter security, Network zoning and Traffic separation и Secure operation and maintenance и Reactive Security Measures и Network Element security

What is Coming in 5G realm?
и Complex ecosystem with multiple stakeholders requires trusted and trouble-free interaction between them
и Migration to NFV/SDN introduces new security challenges
и Need for flexible security measures depending on use case
и Growing influence of availability and integrity of network service on human security or even life

...and escalating cybersecurity threats and breaches

Compliance mandates
GDPR fines can cost
billions
for large global companies

Skills shortage
By 2022, there will be
1.8 million
unfulfilled cybersecurity positions

From LTE to 5G: Adopting New Networking Paradigms
LTE
5G
11

3GPP standard Security Architecture 4G vs 5G, a brief comparison
4G (LTE) Security
UE is authenticated by 2 methods: a. LTE AKA on LTE access and; b. EAP AKA' on Wifi access.
Roaming: No authentication confirmation to Home network
MME is considered a trusted node in the authentication process.
UE Subscription identifier (IMSI) is not a secret, as it is sent over-the-air (Prone to IMSI-catching)
No Integrity Protection of User data, packet injection is possible
Core Network is not Service Based
12

#RSAC
5G Security
Access agnostic security- network authenticate UE: Either 5G AKA or EAP AKA' regardless of access type. An authentication confirmation is sent to the Home AUSF, when UE gets authenticated while roaming. Security Anchor Function is introduced to augment AMF security, deployable in the network edge. Permanent Subscription Identifier (SUPI) is not sent in over the air in any network procedures (Prevents IMSI catchers, avoids fake eNBs)
Supports Integrity Protection of User Plane data, avoids packet injection. Supports Service Based Core Network architecture and better interPLMN security.

Key Cloud Security Risks Security Challenges
Virtualization attack surface
Hypervisor and Virtual Machine (VM) vulnerabilities distribute attacks to virtual infrastructure

#RSAC

Dynamically distributed resources
Dynamicity, Agility and Site Distribution requires constantly updated Safeguards

Shared Resources and Privacy
Isolation principle is weakened by shared resources which puts Privacy at risk

Sensitive VNF Data

SDN security exposure

Location and trust level of the platform are not guaranteed during VNF deployment (snapshot, image)

SDN controller and communication channel requires safeguards

Cloud Orchestration vulnerabilities
Insecure API allows deployment of malicious VM

и Exploiting known vulnerabilities
и App manipulation и Password guessing и Buffer overflow и Privillege escalation и VNF impersonation
и Route BGP/VRF injection и Traffic sniffing и Data model injections и VMI DKSM attacks

и External threats Г Attacker can use a vulnerability in the user's VM to take a control of it, then move laterally to other VMs in the cloud until the attacker puts their hand on the crown jewels.
и Threats from a cloud provider Г Attacker can use a cloud misconfiguration for escalation of privileges or information disclosure. For example, an attacker can launch a new VM, and attach a volume that was used by a previously running user VM to access sensitive user data.
и Threats from another tenant Г Attacker can, for example, run an escalation of privileges to escape their VM and take a control over the host and/or other tenants. Attacker can also get access to shared resources, such as storage or network resources.

и Memory/ Side channel attacks
и Storage attacks

Four key 5G security operations capabilities to help CSPs build digital trust
Security operations
Comprehensive visibility
"I want to see everything happening in my environment and normalize it."
Integrated intelligence
"Help me understand what to look for and what others have discovered."
High-powered analytics
"Give me the speed and smarts to detect, investigate, and prioritize potential threats."
22

#RSAC
Best practices- Use of next generation technologies in 5G Security

Multi dimensional analytics
и Analytics are important because many threats are designed to stay undetected for as long as possible, Analytics will help in the aspect of "visibility" from the device up through the network and into the cloud.
и Without the ability to collect, correlate and analyze data from end to end, security threats could easily be missed.
и Analytics will provide a comprehensive real-time view of all the key components

Machine Learning
и Prediction and automation is achieved through Machine Learning
и A few uses of ML are и To correlate data from multiple domains, sources и Catch anomalies и Provide contextual intelligence about threats и Weigh business risks in a structured manner и Recommend (or enact) mitigation steps.
и ML and Analytics are integral part of SOAR strategy.

Blockchain
и Blockchain can be utilized for credibility verification in the IoT scenario
и The idea is to establish a credibility verification structure, data flow and a credibility verification process
и The primary objective of the process is to prevent any device spoofing So, the device will have to perform three specific activities, и share its certificate и confirm that the device is the original one и Prove the data is original
и This is a novel & effective approach.

Key is to achieve Visibility, Prediction and Automation

Network Slicing Security & Network Slice Isolation

Slicing across radio, transport, core, edge and central clouds
Autonomous driving
Health SmartMeter

Cloud scalability and efficiency

Flexibility to meet diverse requirements

Self service

Utility Automotive Health

Network Slice Isolation = Resource Isolation + Security Isolation и Resources dedicated to one slice cannot be consumed by another slice. и Data/traffic cannot be intercepted/faked by entities of another slice.
Isolation is a crucial security aspect in network slicing security

#RSAC

In summary- Key recommendations

Holistic approach
5G Security isn't just a technical issue. People, process and Technology will play an equally important role
Embed Security in the network
5G network will not have conventional boundaries: it will be an open ecosystem with all kinds of unmanaged third-party devices
Advanced Technologies
Multiple layers to be secured at scale, this is impossible with conventional methods, us of advanced concepts like Analytics, ML in security is a must
27

Sound Risk Assessment
Systematic and diligent risk assessment, covering both technical and non-technical aspects of cyber security, is essential to create and maintain a truly resilient infrastructure
Design for Security
CSPs to engage the market and monetize the investments they're making in their networks to deliver on the new 5G use cases at scale
Eco system for sharing
To proactively detect and respond to security threats, security-related intelligence has to be shared across all the stakeholders -suppliers, partners and customers

#RSAC
5G Security must be budgeted
5G security will require transformational changes to the current security mechanisms in CSPs. This requires additional budgets
Co existence of solutions
Multi vendor environments are here to stay in 5G. Select your 5G solutions that support open, multi vendor approach.
5G Security Operations
Automated, adaptive security operations with centralized command control and smart security measures will be the key to success
