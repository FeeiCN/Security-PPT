The Cybersecurity Mental Health Landscape

#RSAC
Parallels between different fields
Medical Professions and Security Professions both involve:  High stress work environments that are constantly changing  Information that cannot be shared  Making decisions with incomplete or unknown information  Keeping up with new and more complex knowledge  Always on alert  Pressures from limited time and resources, team dynamics

#RSAC
Mental Health Stress and Cybersecurity
Challenges of the Profession:
 High expectations as first responders  Words of thanks are rare  Feelings of guilt when things are missed  "Badge of Honor" to take on more responsibilities  Finding holes and filling them
