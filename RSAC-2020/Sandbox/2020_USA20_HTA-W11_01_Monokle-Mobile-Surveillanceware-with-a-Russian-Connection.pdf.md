No logging in most samples C2 traffic will use TLS encryption with certificate pinning Consider all data on device potentially compromised Possibility to analyze email commands if traffic was captured
47

#RSAC
Indicators of Compromise
Monokle continues to be an active threat as of today Lookout released more than 80 indicators of compromise (IOC):  57 SHA-128 hashes and 1 YARA rule for Android malware IOCs  22 domains and IP addresses  Four Russian mobile phone numbers used as attacker control
phones for Monokle
48

#RSAC
Mobile Surveillanceware Trends
 Functionality without rooting
 Use of good encryption techniques and certificate pinning and increased awareness of network traffic forensic techniques
 Number of surveillanceware tools available is only increasing
