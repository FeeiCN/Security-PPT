Overview
 Problems with current tools  Current workarounds  Proposed solutions  Introduction to RAFT
Wednesday, July 27, 2011

Testing Tools Are Lacking
 Hey, Y2K Just called
 Semi-automated tools fall down  Session and state problems  Problems with complicated applications
 What about modern technologies?
 CSRF tokens and randomized DOM  RIA, AJAX, and Web Services
Wednesday, July 27, 2011

The Problems Continue
 Import of externally collected data  Typically no analysis of results
 Current request  Previous requests  HTTP is stateless, but analysis shouldn't be
 Testers need interaction not abstraction
Wednesday, July 27, 2011

The Problems Continue

 Missing "hidden" portions of the application  "Accept" Header manipulation

GET /viaf/75785466/ HTTP/1.1 Host: viaf.org Accept: application/rdf+xml

!= GET /viaf/75785466/ HTTP/1.1 Host: viaf.org

And again
 Difficult cases
 Risk based logins  In-session detection  Confirmation on next step
Wednesday, July 27, 2011

It's The Simple Things
 Missing simple features
 Request time  Authorization checks
Wednesday, July 27, 2011

Mo Tools, Mo Problems
 External tools and custom scripts
 Can be painful with no analysis help  Request/response diffs  Full request/response logging?
 Data in multiple sources
 No cross-tool analysis  Limited ability to find "new" bugs in old data
Wednesday, July 27, 2011

Current Solutions
 Test manually
 Totally not time consuming, at all!  Modify existing tools for purposes which
they weren't intended
 Custom one-off tools and scripts
 End up missing the point
 Results in custom formats  Common vulns can be missed
Wednesday, July 27, 2011

So Adapt Or...
 Some tools need to adapt or become useless

A Web Smart Fuzzer?
Wednesday, July 27, 2011

Web Smart Fuzzer Components
 Session Management
 Without need for complex user interaction  Shared cookie jar object  Proper in-session detection
 Sequence building and running
 Login sequences  Multi-stepped operations  Grabbing data from previous requests
Wednesday, July 27, 2011

Web Smart Fuzzer Components
 Content discovery
 Intelligent spidering  Intelligent form submission  Content discovery based on contextual Info
 Support modern technologies
 HTML5  RIA
Wednesday, July 27, 2011

Web Smart Fuzzer Components
 Randomization handling
 CSRF tokens  DOM data
 Payload choices
 Based on context awareness
 Tight integration of components  Ability to easily experiment

RAFT
 Introducing RAFT
Wednesday, July 27, 2011

RAFT
 Response Analysis and Further Testing  RAFT is different
 Not an inspection proxy  Focus on workflow  Analysis for other tools and scripts
 Open source (Python and QT)
Wednesday, July 27, 2011

Platforms
 Mac OS X
 10.5 / 10.6  10.7 probably fine with Macports
 Linux
 Ubuntu 10.4 LTS  Probably just works on everything else
 Windows
 Windows XP / Windows 7
Wednesday, July 27, 2011

Dependencies
 Effort is made to keep dependencies at a minimum  PyQT4  QtWebKit  QScintilla  lxml  pyamf  pydns
Wednesday, July 27, 2011

RAFT Download
 Check out source from project SVN
 http://code.google.com/p/raft
 Packages for OSX and Windows coming soon
 If you find a bug, and you will, please let us know :)

Analysis
 Don't be caught without an analyzer
Wednesday, July 27, 2011

Analysis
 Analysis Anywhere!
 Our concept for better tools  Any analysis on any data source  Analyzers integrated with other tools
 Modular analyzers
 New analyzers easy to add  Customizable config / execution / reporting  Analyzers can call each other
Wednesday, July 27, 2011

Analysis
 Find what others ignore
 Timing analysis  Same request, different response  Image analysis
 Do you really want to know where your facebook Google+ friends have been?
 Possibilities are endless
Wednesday, July 27, 2011

Smart Testing Components
 Templatized components
 Requester  Fuzzer
 Sequence running
 Login, cleanup, and fuzzing
 Browser object
Wednesday, July 27, 2011

Documentation
 Really?
 Available on the wiki of the project page
Wednesday, July 27, 2011

RAFT Data Formatting
 Other language integration
 XML Capture Format  Python  Ruby  Perl  Java
Wednesday, July 27, 2011

RAFT Future Features
 More analysis components  Integrated scanner functionality  Reporting output  Command line interface
Wednesday, July 27, 2011

Call to Action
 We need help
 Contribute with code  Test and report bugs  Provide integration with other tools
 Future features
 Request new features  Code new features yourself
