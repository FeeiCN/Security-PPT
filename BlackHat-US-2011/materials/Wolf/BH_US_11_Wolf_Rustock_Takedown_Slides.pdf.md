The Past
Wednesday, July 27, 2011

Rustock:The Early Years
 Named `Rustock' around Jan 2006 by Symantec  Also named `RKRustock',`Costrat', and generic
names like `Meredrop' by others
 Initially used IRC for C&C communications  The C&Cs hosted on Russian Business Network  Opened a proxy on the victim to relay spam  Used Standard Windows Rootkit tricks to hide
(SSDT Hooking, ZwOpenKey, ADS, etc.)
Wednesday, July 27, 2011

Circa 2007
 More-Efficient Template based spambot  Uses HTTP for C&C communications  Propagated via drive-by exploits and spam
with sensational subject lines
 Spam messages using Microsoft's trademark  Spam for counterfeit Pfizer pharmaceuticals  Spam for penny stocks, etc.

Circa 2008
 C&Cs mostly hosted at Atrivo/Intercage... Until September 2008
 ...Then C&Cs mostly hosted at McColo... Until November 2008
 Joe Stewart estimated about 130,000 bots in Rustock at the time.

Wednesday, July 27, 2011

Circa 2008
 Rustock used hard-coded IPs for C&Cs, after McColo it switched to using static DNS
 On the weekend of Nov 15, McColo regained peering through TeliaSonera for about twelve hours
 An update was pushed out to the botnet, relocating the C&C servers in Russia
Wednesday, July 27, 2011

Circa 2009
 Propagated via Pay-Per-Install [Piptea]  Propagated via drive-by-download attacks  Pharmacy spam...  Blah, blah, more of the same...  Oh yeah, and sending about 50% of all spam
on Earth
Wednesday, July 27, 2011

Circa 2010
 Stopped sending spam approximately between Dec 25, 2010 and Jan 9, 2011
 No one is certain why yet, but lots of speculation:
 May have had something to do with "SpamIt/Glavmed" going down in Oct.
 Maybe someone involved got arrested  Maybe the botnet operator(s) went on
vacation [or were abducted by aliens...]
Wednesday, July 27, 2011

Technical Advancements 2009-2010
 Began using pseudo-random DNS names for C&C backup
 Used a slight variation of RC4 to encrypt communications
 DNS answers for C&Cs would return an obfuscated IP address, which Rustock would transform into the real thing 1.2.3.4 -> 5.6.7.8

Technical Advancements 2009-2010
 Began using TLS/SSL for SMTP transport, and then stopped using it after several months, possibly for performance reasons.

 March 16, 2011: US Federal Marshals and the Dutch High Tech Crime Unit seize all Rustock C&C physical servers

Operation b107
 Operation b49,Waledac takedown in 2010 - DNS name transfer to Microsoft
 Not applicable to Rustock  Richard Boscovich had a great idea:  Lanham Trademark Act (15 U.S.C.)  And also, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
(18 U.S.C) and CAN-SPAM Act (15 USC)
Wednesday, July 27, 2011

Operation b107
"Enter a preliminary and permanent injunction isolating and securing the botnet infrastructure, including the software operating from and through the Command and Control IP Addresses/ Domains and placing that infrastructure outside of the control of the Defendants or their representatives or agents."
TL;DR We want to to seize all the computers.
Wednesday, July 27, 2011

Lanham Trademark Act
 Allows companies to seize [alleged] counterfeit goods and trademark infringing materials
 The Rustock C&C servers [are believed to] contain spam templates for emails claiming to be from Microsoft, and for counterfeit Pfizer pharmaceuticals
 ...Which are all fraudulently using Microsoft and Pfizer's trademarks
Wednesday, July 27, 2011

Since March
 Brian Krebs may have found at least one person behind the operation of the Rustock Botnet:Vladimir Alexandrovich Shergin (who doesn't pay his hosting bills)
 Another suspect associated with SpamIt goes by "Cosma2k," possibly named Dmitri A. Sergeev,Artem Sergeev, or Sergey Vladomirovich Sergeev
 Name is kinda like "John Smith" in English

Since March
 Microsoft has been running advertisements in the newspapers circulated near where the operators are believed to be
 They have also been trying to contact all of the alleged operators via email, phone, and ICQ; Basically saying: "Hey, we have your stuff, tell us if we're mistaken."
 So far, no one has contacted Microsoft complaining about their servers being sized

From The Court Filing
 I find this quote hilarious:
"No Customers of the IP addresses in question, or the domains in question have requested that the IP addresses and domains be reinstated."

Current Botnet Size
 Data Measured by Microsoft's Sinkhole  Mar 20-26, 2011: 1,601,619  June 12-18, 2011: 702,860
