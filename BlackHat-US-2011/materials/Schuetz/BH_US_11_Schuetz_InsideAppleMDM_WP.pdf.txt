THE IOS MDM PROTOCOL
Abstract: Mobile Device Management (MDM) has become a hot topic as organizations are pressured to bring iStuff into their organization. Mobile devices are invading every level of corporate society, making the need to remotely manage and control them increasingly urgent. Apple has provided some enterprise management features, first via over-the-air configuration profiles, and beginning in 2010, full MDM support. Unfortunately, the exact features available through MDM, as well as details of the protocol itself, have not been publicly released by Apple.
This paper describes how Apple's MDM system works. It details the method by which an MDM server initiates a connection to a managed device, how the device enrolls with the server, and the various commands available to the system. Full parameters are provided for each command, as well as details for specialized responses from the device. Finally, source code is provided for a very simple MDM server, that will permit basic experimentation with the MDM protocol using actual iOS devices.

Introduction
The use of iOS devices, such as the iPhone, iPad or iPod, can present a serious risk to an organization. These devices are powerful computers with high storage capacity and can potentially exfiltrate data beyond corporate control and release it, deliberately or accidentally, to unauthorized third parties. Many protections available for iOS focus on the device itself, such as the use of passcodes to prevent a 3rd party from accessing the data on the device. However, managing such "iStuff" presents a serious challenge to the large enterprise, and has historically been a complicated and cumbersome process.
The easiest way to configure a device is through the iOS Settings application. Of course, this requires direct physical access to the device, which becomes increasingly impractical as the installed base of iOS devices grows.
To ease this, Apple created the iPhone Configuration Utility (IPCU), which directly installs custom .mobileconfig files over USB. An extension to this capability allows Over the Air (OTA) configuration -- letting the end user click on a link to fetch and install new profiles.
But even the OTA configuration method has its drawbacks, not least the requirement of enduser interaction. Then, in 2010, Apple introduced Mobile Device Management (MDM) services for iOS, a solution to the problem of iOS MDM, targeted at the enterprise. This system features remote installation of profiles, querying of device settings, and certain remote controls: lock, unlock, and remote wipe of a device.
Unfortunately, documentation of the underlying protocol has never been freely available. Obviously, third parties selling MDM servers were provided access to the documentation by Apple, but it's not been available for researchers or smaller development shops. This hampers risk analysis for enterprises making use of MDM. In order to aid such risk assessments, and to enable and encourage future research, this project was born.
The goal is not to create a simple, turn-key, stand-alone MDM server, nor to probe the protocol for weaknesses or hidden features, but simply to document as much of the protocol as possible. It is hoped that future researchers may build upon this documentation to better understand the security of MDM, and in particular, of various implementations of MDM servers and clients.
Disclaimer
This work was performed without use of any Apple confidential material subject to NonDisclosure Agreements. At the time of writing, OS X 10.7 (Lion) and iOS 5 were both available in Developer Preview, but neither system was utilized in the deciphering of the MDM protocol. Lion's contribution to this research was limited to the acquisition of an Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) certificate, while iOS 5 hasn't even been downloaded, let alone installed on any devices. All work was performed on OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard), and tested with multiple iOS devices (running a mix iOS 4.2.1, 4.3, and 4.3.1).

Background
Basic user configuration changes are made in the Settings application. Many of these settings are stored as Property List (.plist) files on the device, in /var/mobile/Library/ ConfigurationProfiles, along with profiles installed by IPCU or MDM. For example, the file UserSettings.plist may contain the following:

<plist version="1.0"> <dict>
<key>assignedObject</key> <dict/> <key>restrictedBool</key> <dict>
<key>allowAccountModification</key> <dict>
<key>value</key> <true/> </dict> <key>allowAddingGameCenterFriends</key> <dict> <key>value</key> <true/> </dict> <key>allowAppInstallation</key> <dict> <key>value</key> <true/> </dict> <key>allowAppRemoval</key> <dict> <key>value</key> <true/> </dict>
[...remainder not shown...]

In this case, we can see (for example) that installing applications is permitted by the local user. If the user were to enter Settings, and navigate to General -> Restrictions to turn off the App Store, then the value for "allowAppInstallation" would be changed to "false."
These configuration files are not normally visible to the end user, but can be accessed on a jailbroken device. Understanding how these are formatted and interpreted by the operating system is useful to decoding how MDM works as a whole.

The iOS MDM Protocol

August 3, 2011

If the user, or their IT Admin Staff, installs a new profile via IPCU that restricts certain items, that profile is also stored in this same folder, but in a different .plist file. An excerpt from a profile might include the following:

[.....]
<plist version="1.0"> <dict>
<key>InstallDate</key> <date>2011-07-05T17:49:37Z</date> <key>MCProfileIsRemovalStub</key> <true/> <key>PayloadContent</key> <array>
<dict> <key>PayloadDescription</key> <string>Configures device restrictions.</string> <key>PayloadDisplayName</key> <string>Restrictions</string>
[.....] <key>allowAddingGameCenterFriends</key> <true/> <key>allowAppInstallation</key> <false/>
[...remainder not shown...]

So now, the device has two profiles -- the locally-created one (UserSettings.plist) which permits the App Store, and one (installed by IPCU) which disables it. In such a situation, it's been observed that the more restrictive setting "wins": in this case, the App Store would be disabled. The merged settings are cached in ProfileTruth.plist, and additional files in the PublicInfo subdirectory.

MDM Protocol Overview
Thus far, all the configuration profiles discussed were installed manually -- either through the device's Settings application or via locally-initiated USB or wireless download of a profile. A key feature of MDM is that it allows administrators to push profiles to the device without any manual intervention.
Basics The MDM service essentially consists of three elements:
1. The device being managed (iPhones, iPads, iPod Touches)
2. The server doing the management (various MDM servers)
3. A method by which the server wakes up the device (APNS)
Enrollment MDM servers support over-the-air (OTA) enrollment, as documented in Apple's "Over-the-Air Profile Delivery and Configuration" developer guide1. The OTA enrollment can implement various challenge and response systems, both to authenticate the user and to ensure that only desired devices are enrolled in the system. However, the OTA system relies on a Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) server, and is beyond the scope of this research.
Enrollment is also possible through a profile created by the iPhone Configuration Utility. The user specifies the network address of the MDM server, provides some additional information, and installs the profile directly on the device to be managed.
During enrollment, the device provides unique identifying information to that server, which is used by the server to send messages through the Apple Push Notification Service. Long term connections from server to client, or client to server, do not exist with the design of MDM -- only the connection to APNS. This long-term APNS connection is part of the Push Notifications framework supporting multiple iOS applications, not just MDM.
After enrollment, each interaction between client devices and the MDM server consists of four elements [see also diagram on the next page]:
1. Server requests push notification through Apple
2. Apple pushes notification to device
3. Device connects to server
4. Server and client exchange commands and responses

1 See Appendix C for referenced documents.

The iOS MDM Protocol

Push Notification
When the MDM server needs to communicate with a device, it queues up the desired command, then sends a very simple push notification message through APNS. No information other than an identifying token is present in this message. Upon receipt of the notification, the device contacts the server, which then provides the queued command to the client. Upon completion of the command, the client responds with an appropriate acknowledgment, and the connection between client and server is closed.
Client / Server Interaction
The device interacts with the server by connecting to a designated URL and exchanging XML formatted data, in the form of an Apple Property List (.plist) file. The first message a client sends upon connecting to the server is a simple "Status: Idle" notification, indicating that the device is ready to receive commands from the MDM server.
Upon receipt of this message, the server sends whatever command may be waiting for that device. This command is also presented as an XML formatted .plist file, and in most cases is only a simple command (with perhaps some associated arguments).
The device acts upon the command, and may then respond with another .plist, providing either a simple acknowledgement of the command, an error message, or a detailed response (in the case of device inventories and similar commands).
Creating a Simple MDM Server
A very basic MDM server can be created in fewer than five pages of Python, using only basic libraries. This section will describe such a server in detail, and full source code will be provided in Appendix B.
Requirements
APNS: The most important requirement is acquisition of an APNS push certificate. In the past, such a certificate was only available to members of the Apple Enterprise Developer program (with annual fees of $300). However, with the delivery of Lion, basic MDM services are bundled with Lion Server, available for only $49.99.

The iOS MDM Protocol

Python: This demonstration server was built on OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard), using Python version 2.6. Libraries used include web.py, pprint, plistlib, and APNSWrapper. Some of these are standard libraries, others are readily available on the net. The APNSWrapper library itself depends on the commonly-installed OpenSSL package.
Network Connectivity: To send push notifications, the server needs to communicate with Apple's APNS server: This requires outbound TCP connectivity to gateway.push.apple.com on port 2195. The devices being managed likewise need connectivity to APNS, via outbound TCP port 5223. Finally, the device needs to be able to contact the MDM server itself on whatever port is defined in the MDM enrollment profile.
Caveats and Disclaimers
Again, the intended use of this tool is not to replace actual MDM server products. It is intended to allow for further research into the MDM system, and potential vulnerabilities, in order to better understand the risks it may present, or be used to mitigate, in an enterprise. It does not make use of many features which are arguably required for a production service. Some limitations:
 No transport layer security: all transactions occur over HTTP, though MDM and the utilized web.py framework both support SSL
 No authentication: though a client identity certificate is created, it is not used, nor are any of the server commands signed
 Only manages one device at a time
 Enrollment is accomplished through IPCU-installed profiles, however, because there's no authentication, it's trivial to recreate this profile
 Any new device can therefore enroll with the server and "kick out" the device currently being tested
In other words: This tool is for research purposes only. Dont even think about exposing it to the open Internet, or using it to actively manage devices with important data!
Setting up APNS First, an Apple Push certificate must be acquired. This is what allows the MDM server to communicate with the client, and without it (and the appropriate certificate, provided by Apple) the MDM service will not work. At this time, the easiest way to get an APNS certificate is to purchase OS X Lion Server, though obviously this requires Mac hardware. Within the Server application, the administrator can request and install push notification certificates directly from Apple. Once installed, the certificate can easily be extracted from the keychain.
Open the Keychain Access program, and locate the APNS certificate. In my case, it was named "APSP:<uuid>", where uuid looks like a long random string of hex digits (and, in fact, is essentially just that). Highlight the certificate, and export it to a .p12 file (for example,

The iOS MDM Protocol

August 3, 2011

PushCert.p12). The program will prompt for a password to protect the private key.
Next, open a Terminal window, navigate to the folder where the certificate was saved, and convert the file to .pem format: For example, using openssl pkcs12 -in PushCert.p12 -out PushCert.pem. The password used when exporting the key from Keychain will be needed to open the .p12 file, and a new password will be required to protect the .pem file.
Since this .pem is encrypted, the tool will prompt for the passphrase each time you attempt to send a push notification. To avoid this, first create a copy of the key with no passphrase: openssl rsa -in PushCert.pem -out PlainKey.pem. Then in a text editor, replace the encrypted RSA Private Key section in PushCert.pem with the contents of PlainKey.pem. Once this is complete, the script will be able to access the certificate and key to send notifications without using a passphrase. Of course, be sure that this file is well protected from disclosure, or others will be able to forge your push notifications. (It's probably also a good idea to acquire a push certificate strictly for testing purposes, and not to use any production credentials with this tool).
MDM Enrollment Profile
The next step is to create a profile in the iPhone Configuration Utility2 (IPCU) that will instruct the device to connect to the MDM server. Within IPCU, create a new profile, and select the MDM payload. In the Server field, enter the URL for the server (for example, http://192.168.1.1/server. This will be the main URL that devices use to poll the server for MDM commands. Optionally, a different URL can be entered in the Check In field (for initial connection to the MDM server). The example server should be able to support Check In over the server URL, but in testing this was separated to http://192.168.1.1/checkin.

The iOS MDM Protocol

August 3, 2011

The Topic field needs to contain the User ID listed in the Subject Name section of the APNS push certificate. Finally, an identity certificate for the device needs to be generated, installed via the IPCU Certificates payload, and selected here. This can be a simple certificate generated using the Keychain Access "Certificate Assistant," but keep in mind that it may need to be signed by a trusted entity. If not, then the Certificate Authority (CA) used to sign the identity may need to be installed on the device in order for the device to recognize it. (Though, as mentioned before, this certificate isn't even used by the test server).
Once all is finished, save the configuration, and it's ready to be copied via USB (or over-theair methods) to the iOS device being used for the server testing.
The Enrollment Exchange
As the MDM profile is being installed, the device will attempt to connect to the MDM server. It first sends a basic "Authenticate" request to the Check In URL, providing the device's Universal Device Identifier (UDID) and the Push Notification topic.
This exchange provides the server with an opportunity to accept or deny the enrollment request, based on the Topic and (more likely) the UDID.

PUT: /checkin <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"> <plist version="1.0"> <dict>
<key>MessageType</key> <string>Authenticate</string> <key>Topic</key> <string>com.example.mdm.pushcert</string> <key>UDID</key> <string> [ redacted ] </string> </dict> </plist>

To proceed, the server can respond with a blank plist:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"> <plist version="1.0"> <dict> </dict> </plist>
After receiving this response, the client sends the server a "TokenUpdate" request, containing three key pieces of identifying information:
 PushMagic - a unique token the MDM server sends with each push request
 Token - a unique token that identifies the device to the APNS service, and

The iOS MDM Protocol

August 3, 2011

 UnlockToken - an escrow key used to clear the passcode on the device.
All three tokens have been redacted in the following listing. The PushMagic token is a hexadecimal string, likely a simple random UUID (in UUID format). The Token is a 32-byte binary value, presented as Base64 encoded text, and UnlockToken is a much longer binary string (closer to 2 kilobytes), also encoded in Base64.

PUT: /checkin <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"> <plist version="1.0"> <dict>
<key>MessageType</key> <string>TokenUpdate</string> <key>PushMagic</key> <string> [ redacted uuid string ] </string> <key>Token</key> <data> [ 32 byte string, base64 encoded, redacted ] </data> </data> <key>Topic</key> <string>com.example.mdm.pushcert</string> <key>UDID</key> <string> [ redacted ] </string> <key>UnlockToken</key> <data>
[ long binary string encoded in base64, redacted ] </data> </dict> </plist>

Again, the server doesn't need to provide any response beyond a simple blank plist. Once this is complete, the server retains copies of the tokens, and the device is now fully enrolled.
Sending Push Notifications
When the MDM server needs to contact a device, it sends the device a notification via APNS. This uses a special format of the push notification, where the top-level "aps {}" list is replaced by a single "mdm" value. Unfortunately, the default APNSWrapper library doesn't support this alternate form, and produces messages with both keys. Fortunately, current versions of iOS (at least from 4.2.1 onwards) don't seem to care, though they do log an error on the console.

The iOS MDM Protocol

August 3, 2011

The push notification needs both the device's APNS Token, and the mdm PushMagic token. Sending the notification, using APNSWrapper, is straightforward:

wrapper = APNSNotificationWrapper('PushCert.pem', False) message = APNSNotification() message.token(my_DeviceToken) message.appendProperty(APNSProperty('mdm', my_PushMagic)) wrapper.append(message) wrapper.notify()
The resultant APNS notification's payload will look approximately like this:

{"aps":{},"mdm":"996ac527-9993-4a0a-8528-60b2b3c2f52b"}
Once sent to the APNS server, the notification should be quickly relayed to the device (provided it's currently connected to APNS), and the device will then contact the MDM server for further instructions.
Device Response to Push After receiving the push notification, the client contacts the server to receive instructions. From here forward, it uses the "Server" URL (instead of the "Check In" URL used during enrollment), but everything remains sent over HTTP PUT. First, the device sends a simple "Status: Idle" message:

PUT: /server <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"> <plist version="1.0"> <dict>
<key>Status</key> <string>Idle</string> <key>UDID</key> <string> [ redacted ] </string> </dict> </plist>
The server then responds with whatever command has been queued up for the device. In all cases, the command response includes a "CommandUUID" field that should include a unique random UUID. This allows the server to match commands sent with responses received from the client, but is not necessary (and may currently be left blank).
Most commands are simply the command name, but a few require additional parameters. Details are provided in the command list in Appendix B. For a quick example, we'll look at two commands: DeviceLock and ClearPasscode.

The iOS MDM Protocol

August 3, 2011

Device Lock The DeviceLock command requires no parameters, and is simply the following:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"> <plist version="1.0"> <dict>
<key>Command</key> <dict>
<key>RequestType</key> <string>DeviceLock</string> </dict> <key>CommandUUID</key> <string></string> </dict> </plist>
When this is provided to the device, as the response to the Status: Idle command, the
device immediately locks. The response from the device is the standard acknowledgement
message:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"> <plist version="1.0"> <dict>
<key>CommandUUID</key> <string></string> <key>Status</key> <string>Acknowledged</string> <key>UDID</key> <string> [ redacted ] </string> </dict> </plist>

The iOS MDM Protocol

August 3, 2011

Clear Passcode
The ClearPasscode command requires the device's UnlockToken (which was provided to the server during the enrollment phase, in the UpdateToken message):

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"> <plist version="1.0"> <dict>
<key>Command</key> <dict>
<key>RequestType</key> <string>ClearPasscode</string> <key>UnlockToken</key> <data> [ redacted ] </data> </dict> <key>CommandUUID</key> <string></string> </dict> </plist>
If the UnlockToken matches what was created during enrollment, then the device should
clear the passcode. It will remain locked, but no passcode will be required to unlock. If a
policy exists that requires a passcode, the user will be given a grace period to enter a new passcode.

This warning will also appear if a new policy is installed that changes the passcode requirements.

The iOS MDM Protocol

Using the Example Program
To use the example MDM test program, first follow the steps listed above in "Creating a Simple MDM Server". The default port will be 8080, so be sure to use that in the manual MDM enrollment profile created in IPCU (or adjust accordingly).
In order to test installation and removal of profiles, create a basic Configuration Profile or Provisioning Profile in IPCU and save them as "test.mobileconfig" and "test.mobileprovision" in the same directory as the server. Once created, the UUID for the Provisioning Profile will need to be updated within the source, or demonstrating removal of the test Provisioning Profile will not be possible.
Once running, simply open a browser to the server's port (such as http://localhost: 8080). A very simple interface should appear:

First, you'll need to enroll the test device with the server. Connect the device via USB and use IPCU to install the manual MDM configuration profile. The device should immediately connect to the server, issue the Authenticate and TokenUpdate commands, and complete installation. Nothing will be displayed in the browser, but the terminal in which the server process runs should show logs of the traffic reaching the server.
Once the device has been enrolled, the USB connection can be removed -- all further communication will occur over the air.
Select a command to send from the drop down. Click "Send," and the command data will be displayed in the window as a JSON-formatted string. At this time, the server will send the push notification to the device through Apple's APNS system.
Within a few seconds, the device should connect to the server. The first thing it will do is submit a "Status: Idle" message, which tells the server the device is ready to accept a command. The server will reply with the command selected, and within a few seconds, the device should provide the response to the command via another HTTP PUT.
Once the response has been received, click "Refresh" in the lower half of the browser window to display the result, which again has been formatted in JSON for easy interpretation.

Shown below is the command, and response, for a SecurityInfo command.

Conclusion
Overall, Apple's MDM protocol is reasonably straightforward, and not difficult to implement. Appendix A outlines as much of the protocol as has been deciphered to date, while Appendix B provides the source code to the MDM test server described in this paper.
Though this documentation is reasonably complete, there are some known shortcomings:
 An exhaustive documentation of error conditions and responses, both from the server and from the client, has not been undertaken
 Additional controls may be present in the protocol, but exist as optional parameters, and so have not been discovered (nor documented)
 Setup interactions with the APNS server, including the derivation of the Device Token, have not been investigated
 A detailed investigation of SSL-secured MDM interactions, including the potential for signed commands and responses, has not yet commenced
Despite these shortcomings, it is hoped that this effort may inspire further research into the security and reliability of iOS Mobile Device Management, leading to a better understanding of the risks iOS devices may present to large enterprises, and, ultimately, to more secure systems and networks.

Each command is listed below with a short description, and the required parameters.

The iOS MDM Protocol
Responses
The device responds to many commands with a simple acknowledgment:
<plist version="1.0"> <dict>
<key>CommandUUID</key> <string></string> <key>Status</key> <string>Acknowledged</string> <key>UDID</key> <string>[device UUID]</string> </dict> </plist>

The "Status" field may contain "Acknowledged", "Error", "CommandFormatError", or "NotNow" (see below for details on the error fields).
Where commands elicit a more extended response (such as for DeviceInformation queries), details of those responses are given below. Typically, these commands add a toplevel field (such as InstalledApplicationList) which has as its value the extended data, stored as a string, dict, or array of other elements. For example:
<plist version="1.0"> <dict>
<key>CommandUUID</key> <string></string> <key>SecurityInfo</key> <dict>
<key>HardwareEncryptionCaps</key> <integer>3</integer> <key>PasscodeCompliant</key> <true/> <key>PasscodeCompliantWithProfiles</key> <true/> <key>PasscodePresent</key> <false/> </dict> <key>Status</key> <string>Acknowledged</string> <key>UDID</key> <string>[device UUID]</string> </dict> </plist>

The iOS MDM Protocol

Error Messages
The general format for an error message is the same as the acknowledgement, with "Status" changed to "Error" and an additional array of dicts added as "ErrorChain":

ErrorCode

(integer) A unique identifying error code

ErrorDomain

(string) Category of error

LocalizedDescription (string) Error message, translated to a localized language

USEnglishDescription (string) Standardized version of error message

A special error message is "NotNow", which is seen when a command cannot be requested because the device is locked with a passcode (such as requesting Security Information or installing a profile). When that occurs, the device will attempt to re-connect with the MDM server as soon as the device is unlocked, in order to retry the command.
A command sent with invalid or missing parameters returns the "CommandFormatError" status.
Device Lock Immediately locks the device. If a passcode is present, that passcode will be required to unlock the device.

Restrictions List
Lists restrictions currently in effect on the device. For example, lists disabled applications, whether backup encryption is forced on, etc.

RequestType

RestrictionsList

The response includes "GlobalRestrictions", which is a dict containing detailed list of restrictions, most presented as boolean values. The exact content and structure depends on the restrictions in place on the device.
Install Profile
Given a base-64 encoding of a .mobileconfig profile (as created by the IPCU or other tools), installs the profile on the device.

RequestType Payload

InstallProfile (data) IPCU .mobileconfig file, base-64 encoded

Remove Profile
Given a payload identifier (which is typically shown as a reverse-DNS identifier such as "com.example.cfg.restrictions"), removes the profile from the device.

RequestType Identifier

RemoveProfile (string) Profile identifier

Install Provisioning Profile
Given a base-64 encoding of a .mobileprovision profile (as created by the IPCU or other tools), installs the profile on the device.

RequestType Payload

InstallProvisioningProfile
(data) IPCU .mobileprovision file, base-64 encoded

Remove Provisioning Profile This command removes the provisioning profile from the device, given the profile's UUID.

RequestType UUID

RemoveProvisioningProfile (string) Provisioning profile UUID

Authenticate
This is a client command, sent by the client to initiate enrollment. Can be used by the server to permit or deny enrollment based on the device's UDID. NOTE - Does not follow same format as server-to-client commands. Has no CommandUUID field nor the Command dict structure -- all parameters are top-level items in the main property list dict.

MessageType Topic
UDID

Authenticate
(string) Subject Name: User ID on APNS push certificate used by server
(string) Device UDID

Token Update
This is a client message, sent by the client during enrollment. Provides the server with tokens used to contact device via APNS, as well as a key to unlock the device through the Clear Passcode command. NOTE - Does not follow same format as server-to-client commands. Has no CommandUUID field nor the Command dict structure -- all parameters are top-level items in the main property list dict.

MessageType PushMagic Token
Topic
UDID UnlockToken

Token Update
(string) UUID-like string
(data) 32-byte APNS device token, base-64 encoded
(string) Subject Name: User ID on APNS push certificate used by server
(string) Device UDID
(data) Device unlock key, base-64 encoded
