Problem

Problem: A lot of targeted attacks
More than 40 APT
7|

Problem: The biggest issue is...

Question: What is the biggest problem in APT seen from antivirus side?

Hard work

No sample

No detect

We collect mass spread samples. However, we could not get APT samples easily. Especially, second stage sample is extremely rare.

8|

Problem: Corrupted samples
We found samples, sometimes they were corrupted. That means they are executable but crashing:
1. Memory dump 2. Unknown binary data 3. Broken data 4. Cured by Anti Virus 5. Quarantined file 6. Password encrypted archive without password

Problem: Why corrupted samples?
Question: Why corrupted samples in recent APT?
I will tell you my answer in conclusion

Motivation

Motivation: What should we do?

Question: What should we do when we got corrupted malware in APT?

Just Ignore

Make AV signature

Deep Analysis

1. Checking really corrupted or not 2. Getting information of related others
12 |

Motivation: Two recent APT cases
Probably corrupted (?) samples have found in two recent APT.

Emdivi

Elirks

13 |

Emdivi

Emdivi: Overview
1. The Blue Termite APT campaign 2. Target region is Japan mainly 3. C2s on compromised legitimate sites 4. spear phishing email 5. drive-by dowonload 6. Watering hole attacks 7. CVE-2014-7247 8. CVE-2015-5119

CVE-2015-5119

emdivi t17 emdivi t20

Emdivi: Target
Regions:  Japan  Taiwan
Industries: 1. Government 2. Universities 3. Financial services 4. Energy 5. Food 6. Heavy industry 7. Chemical 8. News media 9. Health care 10. Insurance 11. Security researcher 12. Internet service provider

Japan Hosting provider
Taiwan web site

Emdivi: Corrupted (?) samples
We collected more than 600 samples related to this attacks, around 25 percents were Emdivi samples. Among them, 6 percents did not work.
19 |

Emdivi: Important data was encrypted

Emdivi family stores encrypted important data: C2, API name, strings for anti-analysis, value of mutexes, as well as the md5 checksum of backdoor commands and the internal proxy information

generate_base_key salt1 = md5sum(version.c2id...) salt2 = hardcoded long data

axxetseakekye(y1(632bybteyt)e) Modified xxtea_decrypt

encrypted data

%program files%

20 |

Emdivi: Corrupted (?) ustomized samples

generate_base_key salt1 = md5sum(version.c2id...) salt2 = hardcoded long data salt3 = SID of specific victim

axxetseakekye(y1(632bybteyt)e) xxtea_decrypt + add and sub

encrypted data

u%npkrnoogwranmdafilteas%

Is it possible to analyze?
We could brute force a xxtea key

Emdivi: Corrupted (?) ustomized samples
We published the details as a blog in securelist.com
Is it possible to analyze? No

Elirks

Elirks: Overview
1. As known as PLURK 2. The Elirks APT campaign 3. Unique schema to connect real C2 4. Target Regions are Taiwan, Japan 5. Trojan dropper is fake folder icon 6. Decoys were sometimes airline e-ticket
This group uses several types of malware Elirks, Ymailer, Ymailer-mini and Micrass. This presentation is forcusing Elirks

Elirks: Unique schema to connect real C2
The Elirks malware has unique schema to connect real C2. It connects blogpost of legitimate site getting encrypted real C2 information.

Elirks: Corrupted (?) samples
We collected more than 200 samples. Among them, less than 3 percent were probably corrupted. Then we confirmed why these samples does not work.

Elirks: Elirks has three encrypted data

generate_base_key data_of_key_salt

aes key (16 byte)

anti emu key (1 byte / 2 byte) aes_expkey_array[4]

aes_decrypt

Elirks: Corrupted (?) samples
A corrupted (?) sample does not decrypt malware config. That means does not work and can not analyze.

0x41CE28 malware config (1504 byte)

Elirks: DEMO Elirks probably corrupted (?) sample

Elirks: Corrupted (?) ustomized samples
It was customized sample for specific victims Compare specific dir and current dir to extract 4 bytes xor key as part of generate AES key
aes key (16 byte)

Conclusion

Conclusion: Answer of my title's question
Question: Why corrupted (?) samples in recent APT?
It's not corrupted. The attacker developed
customized malware
When you find corrupted sample, It might to be chance of analysis very interesting APT malware
37 |

Conclusion: Whitelist approach in APT
Common malware should work in any environment.
APT malware have to work in specific environment.
This approach and introduced new techniques are very simple ,However it works effectively.
