Get Started with Prisma Access
Prisma Access helps you deliver consistent security to your remote networks and mobile users. All your users, whether at your headquarters, branch offices, or on the road, connect to Prisma Access to safely use cloud and data center applications as well as the internet. Prisma Access delivers protection at scale with global coverage so you don't have to worry about things like sizing and deploying firewalls at your branches, or building out and managing appliances in collocation facilities. Palo Alto Networks provides two ways to deploy and manage Prisma Access: Panorama Managed Prisma Access--If you are already using Panorama to manage your nextgen firewalls, you can deploy Prisma Access with Panorama management to leverage you existing configurations. Cloud Managed Prisma Access--If you don't have Panorama or if you just want a simplified onboarding and management experience for Prisma Access, use the Prisma Access app on the hub to quickly and easily enable internet access for your Prisma Access users, and then extend connectivity into your HQ, data center, and branch networks. > Prisma Access > Decide How You Want to Manage Prisma Access > License and Activate Prisma Access

Prisma Access
To keep your applications and data safe, you must secure all users at all locations all the time. But how do you do this when your footprint is expanding globally, more and more of your users are mobile, and your applications and data are moving out of your network and into the cloud? Prisma Access enables this consistent security by safely enabling your users to access cloud and data center applications as well as the internet whether they are at your headquarters, branch offices, or on the road. Prisma Access consistently inspects all traffic across all ports, enabling secure access to the internet, as well as to your sanctioned SaaS applications, public cloud environments, and data centers and headquarters. Because Prisma Access leverages the next-generation firewall capability, threat prevention, malware prevention, URL filtering, SSL decryption, and application-based policy capabilities are built-in to provide you with the same level of security no matter where your users are or what resources they are accessing. All Prisma Access logs are stored in the Cortex Data Lake, providing centralized analysis, reporting, and forensics across all users, applications, and locations. Prisma Access delivers protection at scale with global coverage so you don't have to worry about things like sizing and deploying hardware firewalls at your branches or building out and managing appliances in collocation facilities. Prisma Access provides the network infrastructure to connect all of your remote branches, your headquarter sites, data centers, and mobile users without requiring you to build out your own global security infrastructure and expand your operational capacity.
With the Prisma Access, Palo Alto Networks deploys and manages the security infrastructure globally based on what you have licensed:  Prisma Access for networks--Secures traffic to and from your branch offices to the internet, other
branches, and to your headquarters and data centers over an IPSec tunnel. You can use any router, SDWAN edge device, or firewall that supports IPSec to connect your remote networks to Prisma Access. Prisma Access then implements a full-mesh VPN within the security overlay, eliminating the complexity and operational overhead normally associated with branch-to-branch networking. You license Prisma Access for networks based on the total bandwidth you need across all sites. You can then allocate the specific amounts of bandwidth you need at each site.  Prisma Access for users--Provides consistent security for your mobile users whether they are accessing applications at your data center, using SaaS applications, or browsing the internet. You can deploy the GlobalProtect app to your users (available for smartphones, tablets, or laptops running Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS and iOS, Android, Google Chrome OS, and Linux) so that they can tunnel the traffic to Prisma Access for policy enforcement and threat prevention. The GlobalProtect app also provides host information profile (HIP) reporting so that you can create granular policies based on device

state to ensure that endpoints adhere to your security standards--for example, they are equipped with the most up-to-date patches, encryption, and virus definitions--in order to access your most sensitive applications. Or, to enable secure access to users on unmanaged devices, you can enable Clientless VPN. Prisma Access dynamically scales in and out per region based on where your users are at the moment. You license Prisma Access for Users based on the number of users. Palo Alto Networks manages the underlying security infrastructure, ensuring it is secure, resilient, up-todate and available to you when you need it. Your organization's responsibility is to onboard branches and mobile users, create policies, query logs, and generate reports.

Decide How You Want to Manage Prisma Access
There are two ways you can manage Prisma Access, but you cannot switch between the management interfaces after you activate your Prisma Access license. Therefore, you must decide how you want to manage Prisma Access before begin setting up the product:  Panorama Managed Prisma Access--Use the Cloud Services plugin on Panorama to set up and
manage Prisma Access. This is a good option if you are already using Panorama to manage nextgeneration firewalls and you have common policy that you want to leverage for access to your corporate applications.  Cloud Managed Prisma Access--Use the Prisma Access app on the Palo Alto Networks hub to quickly onboard branches and mobile users through task-driven workflows that allow you to set up and test your environment in minutes. Cloud Managed Prisma Access simplifies the onboarding process by providing predefined internet access and decryption policy rules based on best practices. Quickly set up IPSec tunnels using defaults suitable for the most common IPSec-capable devices and turn on SSL decryption for recommended URL categories. There are some differences between what is supported on Panorama Managed Prisma Access and Cloud Managed Prisma Access. For a list of feature support in Panorama Managed Prisma Access and Cloud Managed Prisma Access, refer to the compatibility matrix. After you decide which management option you want to use, get started by following the licensing and activation workflow for you option you have selected:  To get started with Panorama Managed Prisma Access, perform license activation from the customer support portal (CSP) and install the Cloud Services plugin on Panorama.  To get started with Cloud Managed Prisma Access, perform license activation from the hub.

License and Activate Prisma Access
Prisma Access provides a flexible licensing scheme so that you can purchase just what you need to secure your remote networks and/or mobile users. In addition, Prisma Access logs to the Cortex Data Lake, so you must deploy Cortex Data Lake before you can proceed with licensing Prisma Access.
 Prisma Access Licenses  Activate Prisma Access
Prisma Access Licenses
The following Prisma Access licensing options are available:
 Prisma Access for networks--To license Prisma Access for networks, you purchase a bandwidth pool, which you can divide among each network location that you onboard in increments of 2 Mbps, 5 Mbps, 10 Mbps, 20 Mbps, 25 Mbps, 50 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 150 Mbps, 300 Mbps, 500 Mbps, or 1000 Mbps.
A remote network's bandwidth speed is enforced equally in both directions. To enable traffic peaks, the service allows you to go 10% over the allocated bandwidth for each site; traffic overages above this peak limit is dropped.  Prisma Access for users--You license Prisma Access for users based on number of users, with tiers from 200 users to more than 100,000 users. Prisma Access for Users requires the GlobalProtect app on each supported endpoint. You can also enable support for unmanaged devices through Clientless VPN. Though there is no strict policing of the mobile user count, the service does track the number of unique users over the last 90 days to ensure that you have purchased the proper license tier for your user base, and stricter policing of user count may be enforced if continued overages occur.  Service Connections--The Prisma Access license includes the option to establish service connections that enable connectivity to resources in your headquarters and/or data center locations. The number of service connections you can add depends on your license:
 If you purchase a Prisma Access for Networks, or if you purchase licenses for both Prisma Access for networks and Prisma Access for users, you can add up to 100 service connections to enable access to services and applications at your corporate network locations. You can add up to three service connections with no license cost; each connection after the third uses 300 Mbps from your licensed remote network bandwidth pool. Prisma Access does not limit the bandwidth over these connections.
 If you purchase a Prisma Access for users license only, you can establish service connections to up to three of your headquarters or data center sites.
After you purchase your license(s), you will receive an email from Palo Alto Networks order fulfillment with the auth code(s) to Activate Prisma Access.
Activate Prisma Access
To activate Prisma Access you must have the auth codes for the license(s) you purchased. For Cloud Managed Prisma Access, you perform activation from the Palo Alto Networks hub.
The instructions here are for activating Cloud Managed Prisma Access. If you need to license Prisma Access with Panorama Management, follow the instructions for licensing Prisma Access from the Customer Support Portal (CSP).
Before you activate your Prisma Access auth codes, make sure you have done the following:
10 PRISMA ACCESS ADMINISTRATOR'S GUIDE (CLOUD MANAGED) | Get Started with Prisma Access

Access
 2019 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

Set Up the Prisma Access for Users Environment
To set up the Prisma Access for users environment you simply need to select the locations and the address for your mobile users to connect to and create some temporary test user accounts. Prisma Access uses this information to provision your mobile user environment. The Prisma Access environment provides predefined security policy rules based on best practices. These rules allow you to securely browse to general internet sites. Review and update these default rules to meet your enterprise needs. After you do this, use your temporary test user accounts to verify that the service is functioning as expected, and that the policy rules are being enforced as expected. When you initially set up your mobile users environment, Prisma Access requires only the minimal settings required to get the environment provisioned so that you can test it. After you finish testing the environment to make sure it is functioning as expected, you can go back into the environment setup and customize it. For example, if you would prefer to use your company domain in the portal address, you can change the address after environment setup. STEP 1 | Launch Prisma Access Cloud Management. STEP 2 | If you are performing a first-time configuration of Prisma Access for users, click Set Up Now
from the Mobile Users widget on the Dashboard. Otherwise select Configure > Mobile Users.
STEP 3 | Enter a Portal Address that mobile users will use to connect to Prisma Access. Prisma Access uses the address you provide to establish the fully qualified domain name for the Prisma Access for users deployment and publishes it to public domain servers. For example, if you set the GlobalProtect portal address to acme, Prisma Access creates a FQDN for acme.gpcloudservice.com and publishes it to public DNS servers. You must use this default domain for initial environment setup. You can come back after your test the environment and customize the portal address to use your company domain. If you want to use your company domain in the portal address instead of the default domain, you can come back and customize the portal address after the provisioning completes successfully.
STEP 4 | Select the Locations where you want to deploy Prisma Access for users. 1. Click Add to see the list of available regions.
PRISMA ACCESS ADMINISTRATOR'S GUIDE (CLOUD MANAGED) | Secure Mobile Users with Prisma Access 21
 2019 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

The map displays the global regions where you can deploy Prisma Access for users: North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Middle East, Asia, Japan, and ANZ (Australia and New Zealand). In addition, Prisma Access provides multiple locations within each region to ensure that your users can connect to a location that provides a user experience tailored to the users' locale. For the best performance, Select All. Alternatively, select the specific locations within each selected region where your users will need access. By limiting your deployment to a single region, you can have more granular control over your deployed regions and exclude regions required by your policy or industry regulations. For the best user experience, if you are limiting the number of locations, choose locations that are closest to your users or in the same country as your users. If a location is not available in the country where your mobile users reside, choose a location that is closest to your users for the best performance.
2. Select All to deploy Prisma Access in all available regions and locations or select a specific region. 3. To select specific location within the region, click the corresponding to add a location or click
Select All to select all locations within the region.

Customize the Mobile User Environment
When you initially set up your mobile users environment, Prisma Access requires only the minimal settings required to get the environment provisioned so that you can test it. After you finish testing the environment to make sure it is functioning as expected, you can go back into the environment setup and customize it. For example, if you would prefer to use your company domain in the portal address, you can change the address after environment setup. Similarly, if you want to customize how your mobile users connect when they are on your internal network, you can go back and set up internal host detection. To customize the environment after provisioning, Edit the Environment Setup from the mobile users configuration summary screen:
You can customize the environment settings at any time based on your enterprise needs:  Customize the Prisma Access Portal Address  Enable Internal Host Detection
Customize the Prisma Access Portal Address
By default, Prisma Access uses the gpcloudservice.com domain to set up the Prisma Access portal address that your mobile users will need to connect to for secure access to the internet and your HQ and data centers. You must use this default domain when you initially set up and test your environment. If you want to customize the domain name after the initial setup to use your company domain, you can go back and edit the environment settings so that the portal address your users connect to contains your own company domain (for example, prisma-access.acme.com). To configure Prisma Access to use your own domain, you must:
28 PRISMA ACCESS ADMINISTRATOR'S GUIDE (CLOUD MANAGED) | Secure Mobile Users with Prisma
Access
 2019 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

Obtain certificates for the service. Create a DNS CNAME entry on your DNS servers that maps the default portal address using the default domain to the custom portal address that uses your company domain. You need to do this because Prisma Access publishes the portal address you set up to public domain servers during initial provisioning. STEP 1 | Set the Portal Address Type to Use Company Domain. STEP 2 | Enter the fully qualified Portal Address you want your mobile users to connect to. STEP 3 | Enter the Portal DNS CNAME to which to map your DNS server entries. STEP 4 | Click Add SSL/TLS Service Profile from the SSL/TLS Service Profile drop down.
STEP 5 | Enter a Name for the SSL/TLS profile. STEP 6 | Import the Certificate you provisioned for your custom domain portal address.
1. Enter the Certificate Name and click Choose File to upload the Certificate Fie. 2. Select the certificate Format for the certificate you are importing:
 Encrypted Private Key and Certificate (PKCS12)--The key and certificate are in a single container (Certificate File). Click Choose File and browse to the PKCS12 file to import.
 Base64 Encoded Certificate (PEM)--If you select this option, you must import the Key File separately from the certificate. To import the PEM certificate and Key File, click Choose File.
3. Enter the Passphrase to encrypt the key and Confirm Passphrase and then click Save. STEP 7 | Define the range of SSL/TLS protocols to allow to connect to Prisma Access:
1. For Min Version, select the earliest allowed TLS version (TLSv1.0 is the default). 2. For Max Version, select the latest allowed SSL/TLS version.
As a best practice, set the Min Version to TLSv1.2 and the Max Version to Max.
STEP 8 | Save the configuration. STEP 9 | If you have not already done so, configure your DNS servers to point to the Prisma Access
DNS CNAME you defined. STEP 10 | Save the environment setup and Commit and Push the updated settings.

Enable Internal Host Detection
If you do not require your mobile users to connect to Prisma Access when they are on the internal network, enable internal host detection to enable the GlobalProtect app to determine if it is on an internal or external network. STEP 1 | Enable Internal Host Detection. STEP 2 | Enter the IP Address of a host that can be resolved from the internal network only. STEP 3 | Enter the DNS Hostname that resolves to the IP address you enter.
When a mobile user connects to Prisma Access, the GlobalProtect app attempts to do a reverse DNS lookup on the specified address. If the lookup fails, the GlobalProtect app determines that it is on the external network and then initiates a connection to Prisma Access.
STEP 4 | Save the environment setup and Commit and Push the updated settings.

Enable Mobile User Authentication for Prisma Access
Prisma Access for users provides enterprise authentication using SAML. To configure SAML you must configure both your service provider (Prisma Access) and the SAML IdP (such as Okta or Active Directory Federation Services ) that you are using with the information they will need to establish a trust relationship. To establish a SAML trust relationship between Prisma Access (the SP) and your IdP, you will need to configure your IdP with information about Prisma Access, including the public certificate to use to authenticate SAML requests from Prisma Access, and the IP addresses of the Prisma Access portal and gateways. In addition, you will need to configure Prisma Access with information about where to send identity requests, how to validate the authenticity of SAML responses, and what mechanism to use to exchange SAML messages (called binding). If your IdP can export the metadata file that includes this information (as well as the IdP certificate), you can import it into Prisma Access. Otherwise you will need to gather this information from your IdP. Use the following steps to configure Prisma Access to authenticate mobile users through SAML: STEP 1 | From your Mobile Users configuration summary (Configure > Mobile Users > <mobile-user-

Enable SSL Decryption for Mobile User Traffic
Prisma Access makes it easy for you to decrypt traffic by providing a default SSL decryption policy based on best practices and a default set of certificates to use for SSL decryption. It is important to decrypt traffic because you cannot protect against threats you cannot see. With decryption enabled, you prevent malicious encrypted content from entering your network and sensitive content from leaving your network concealed as encrypted traffic.
If you have already configured SSL decryption for your remote network configuration, you do not need to configure it again. You can either use the default SSL decryption policy and certificates, or customize the SSL decryption settings. STEP 1 | From your Mobile Users configuration summary (Configure > Mobile Users > <mobile-userconfig>), and Edit SSL Decryption.
STEP 2 | To enable SSL decryption using custom decryption policy rules and certificates: 1. Click Manage SSL decryption rules.

Enable Mobile Users to Access Corporate Resources Using Service Connections
To enable Prisma Access for users to enable internet access only you do not need to set up any networking services because Prisma Access provides a default IP address pool and a cloud default DNS server. However, if you want your mobile users to be able to access internal resources at your headquarters or data center or in branch networks you have onboarded to Prisma Access, you will need to define the IP address pools to use to assign IP addresses to your mobile users, set up the Prisma Access service infrastructure, and, to allow access to your headquarters or data center networks, onboard service connections. If you want your mobile users to connect to your remote network locations, you must configure at least one service connection, even if you do not plan on using the connection to provide access to your data center or HQ locations. Though all branches are fully meshed, mobile user connections are not. Creating a service connection establishes the hub-and-spoke architecture required to enable mobile user traffic to route to your branch networks. In this case, you can minimally configure the service connection as follows:  When you onboard the service connection select a Location that is close to your mobile users.  When you Set Up a Primary IPSec Tunnel for Your Service Connection, configure the IPSec peer
authentication and tunnel settings using placeholder values.  When you Enable Routing and Quality of Service for Your Service Connection, add placeholder IP
Subnets. Because Prisma Access does not route any traffic through this tunnel, just make sure the IP subnet you use doesn't conflict or overlap with other configured subnets connected to Prisma Access. STEP 1 | Launch Prisma Access Cloud Management and select Configure > Mobile Users, select your mobile users configuration, and Edit the Network Services. STEP 2 | Configure the Network Settings for your mobile users.

1. Add the IP Pools for Prisma Access to assign to mobile users. 2. Select the IP Pools Region to which to assign an IP address pool.
Select Worldwide to use the same IP address pool for all mobile users, or select an available region.You can use a single IP address pool for all mobile users in all regions and locations, you can set separate pools for each region where you have mobile users, or you can specify both worldwide and region-specific IP pools. For example, you can add a pool for a specific region and then add a worldwide pool to use for all other regions. Prisma Access then uses the Worldwide IP addresses to scale as add additional locations to accommodate more mobile users. 3. Add an IP address pool to assign to the mobile users in the selected IP Pools Region.
PRISMA ACCESS ADMINISTRATOR'S GUIDE (CLOUD MANAGED) | Secure Mobile Users with Prisma Access 55
 2019 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

The IP address pools you define must meet the following requirements:
As a best practice, define RFC 1918-compliant IP address pools to prevent IP address conflicts. Make sure the IP address pools you define do not overlap with other IP addresses you use internally. Make sure the IP address pools you define do not overlap with the infrastructure IP address pool you are using for Prisma Access. The IP address pools you designate must not overlap with the 100.64.0.0/15 or 169.254.0.0/16 subnetworks because Prisma Access reserves these subnets for internal use. Make sure you designate an IP address pool that allows enough coverage for all mobile users in your organization, based on the following guidelines:
If you plan to use a Worldwide address pool deployed in one or two regions the minimum required IP address pool is /23 (512 IP address). If you plan to use a Worldwide address pool deployed in three or more regions the minimum required IP address pool is /19 (8,192 IP addresses), either in a single IP address pool or spread across multiple pools. If you plan to define IP address pools per region, the minimum pool size in any region is /23 (512 IP addresses). You do not need to assign an IP address pool in regions where you do not plan to deploy Prisma Access. For example, select the US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), and US West (N. California), regions only when you onboard Prisma Access for users, you need to specify an IP address pool for the Americas region only. Keep in mind, however, that users in other regions will not be able to connect to Prisma Access. If you plan to define a mix of Worldwide and regional pools, make sure you allocate at least 512 IP addresses per region. For example, for a three-region deployment, you can specify 1,024 addresses in the Europe region and 512 addresses Worldwide. As a best practice, designate IP address pools so that you have at least one IP address for each unique mobile user in your organization so they can log in simultaneously. If you designate an IP address pool that has a smaller number of IP addresses than your licensed number of users, Prisma Access will display a warning message. However, if you have a limited IP address pool and you do not expect all users to log in concurrently you can bypass the message and use a smaller pool size. 4. Save the IP Address pool settings.
Repeat these steps to add additional IP address pools. 5. Add the DNS Servers that you want Prisma Access to use to resolve DNS requests from your mobile
users. 6. Select the Network Services Region for which to configure DNS settings.
You can Add separate DNS Servers configurations for each region where you have mobile users, or configure a Worldwide configuration. 7. Enter the IP address of the Primary DNS server the to use to resolve internal domains for mobile users in the selected Network Services Region.

Access
 2019 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

8. Enter the IP address of the Secondary DNS server the to use to resolve internal domains for mobile users in the selected Network Services Region. The DNS proxy in Prisma Access sends the requests to the DNS servers you specify. The source address in the DNS request is the first IP address in the IP pool you assign to the region. To ensure that your DNS requests can reach the servers you will need to make sure that you allow traffic from all addresses in your mobile user IP address pool to your DNS servers.
9. If you want to use the DNS servers you specified to resolve internal domains to also resolve public domains, select Use these DNS servers to resolve public domains. If you do not select this option, Prisma Access will use its cloud default DNS serves to resolve requests for public domains.
STEP 3 | If you want your mobile users to be able to access resources on your HQ or data center networks or at other branch locations, you must configure the Prisma Access Infrastructure Settings to enable the network backbone. If you have not already done this, follow the steps to Configure the Infrastructure Settings and then click Next. Save your Mobile Users configuration before proceeding to the next step.
STEP 4 | To enable mobile users to access resources on your HQ or data center networks, you must create service connections. If you have not yet created any service connections, Add or View Service Connection and then configure the service connection settings.

Onboard a Remote Network
To add a new branch network to Prisma Access, you must specify the location and define the amount of bandwidth to allocate to the branch connection. STEP 1 | Launch Prisma Access Cloud Management. STEP 2 | From the Dashboard, click Set Up Now in the Remote Networks widget.
STEP 3 | Branch Name the branch. STEP 4 | Select the amount of Bandwidth you want to allocate to this branch.
You can see how much of your licensed bandwidth is available on the Dashboard Remote Networks widget. To help you determine how much bandwidth a specific site needs, consider the bandwidth available from your ISP at each location. When calculating the amount of bandwidth you need at a site, consider that the bandwidth usage includes both egress and ingress traffic for the remote network connection. For example, if you set the bandwidth at a site to 50 Mbps, Prisma Access provides 50 Mbps of bandwidth on ingress and 50 Mbps of bandwidth on egress. Prisma Access allows bandwidth to go up to 10% over the amount you set for a site without dropping traffic (so, if you allocate 50 Mbps, Prisma Access will allow up to 55 Mbps on ingress and on egress). Calculating bandwidth requirements can be more tricky if you have asymmetric internet connections. In this case you will need to consider bandwidth to and from all of the remote networks in your Prisma Access instance to determine how to configure each site. STEP 5 | Select the Prisma Access Location closest to where your branch is located. STEP 6 | Select the Branch IPSec Device you are using at the branch site to establish an IPSec tunnel with Prisma Access. Based on the device type you select, Prisma Access automatically populates default IKE crypto and IPSec crypto settings so that you don't have to configure them when you set up your IPSec tunnel(s). STEP 7 | Click Next to Set Up a Primary IPSec Tunnel for Your Remote Network.

Set Up a Primary IPSec Tunnel for Your Remote Network
To secure your branch, all traffic to and from the branch network must go through Prisma Access. To do this, you must create an IPSec tunnel from your branch IPSec device to Prisma Access. The following workflow walks you through the steps to create this primary IPSec tunnel, which Internet Key Exchange (IKE) and IPSec configuration settings. You can optionally Set Up a Secondary IPSec Tunnel for Your Remote Network.
STEP 1 | Launch Prisma Access Cloud Management.
STEP 2 | Start from Configure > Remote Networks > IPSec Peer Authentication.  If you just finished the steps to Onboard a Remote Network, clicking Next takes you to this page automatically.  If you've already onboarded your branch, select Configure > Remote Networks select the configuration, and Edit IPSec Peer Authentication.
STEP 3 | Select an IKE Protocol Version for your branch device and Prisma Access to use for IKE negotiation. If you select IKEv1 Only Mode, Prisma Access can use only the IKEv1 protocol for the negotiation. If you select IKEv2 Only Mode, Prisma Access can use only the IKEv2 protocol for the negotiation. If you select IKEv2 Preferred Mode, Prisma Access uses the IKEv2 protocol only if your branch device also supports IKEv2. If your does not support IKEv2, Prisma Access falls back to using the IKEv1 protocol.
STEP 4 | Enter the Pre-Shared Key that your branch device and Prisma Access to will use to authenticate each other and then Confirm Pre-Shared Key.
STEP 5 | For Branch IP Address Type, specify whether you want to use a Static IP Address or a Dynamic IP Address to identify the tunnel endpoint.  Static IP Address--If you select this option, enter the Static IP Address on your branch device to use as the endpoint for the IPSec tunnel.  Dynamic IP Address--If you select this option, you must enable either Branch IKE ID or Prisma Access IKE ID and then supply the Identification Type and the corresponding Identifier.
Because you do not have the values to use for the Prisma Access IKE ID until the remote network is fully deployed, you would typically want to set the Branch IKE ID rather than the Prisma Access IKE ID. If you want to supply a Prisma Access IKE ID for additional peer validation after the remote network is deployed, enable Prisma Access IKE ID and then select the Identification Type you want to use to identify the Prisma Access IPSec device. You can find the Service IP for the Prisma Access peer on the Remote Networks summary page (Configure > Remote Networks), which you can use as the IKE ID.

STEP 6 | Click Next to continue to the Tunnel Settings. STEP 7 | If your branch IPSec device uses policy-based VPN, Add the Proxy IDs that match your policy.
You will only see the Proxy ID settings if the IPSec device type you selected supports policy-based VPN. 1. Enter a name to identify the Proxy ID. 2. Enter the Local IP address or subnet of the proxy. 3. Enter the Remote IP address or subnet of the proxy. 4. Specify the Protocol:
 Number--Allows traffic for a given protocol number.  Any--Allows TCP and/or UDP traffic.  TCP--Allows only TCP traffic.  UDP--Allows only UDP traffic.
5. Save the Proxy ID settings.
68 PRISMA ACCESS ADMINISTRATOR'S GUIDE (CLOUD MANAGED) | Secure Remote Networks with
Prisma Access
 2019 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

STEP 8 | Enter a Tunnel Monitoring IP Address on the branch network for Prisma Access to use determine whether the tunnel is up and, if your branch IPSec device uses policy-based VPN, enter the associated Proxy ID. The tunnel monitoring IP address you enter is automatically added to the list of branch subnetworks.
STEP 9 | Save the tunnel settings STEP 10 | (Optional) Customize the IKE crypto settings used to define the encryption and authentication
algorithms used for the key exchange process in IKE Phase 1. Prisma Access automatically configures a default IKE crypto profile based on the IPSec Device Type you selected when you onboarded the branch. You can either use the default profile or create a custom profile. 1. Specify whether you want to Use Recommended Setup, which enables Prisma Access to
automatically identify the recommended IKE crypto settings for you, or Customize Setup, which enables you to define your own IKE crypto settings. If you Customize Setup, you must configure the following IKE crypto settings:
1. Specify the Diffie-Hellman (DH) groups used to generate symmetrical keys for IKE in the IKE SA negotiation. The Diffie-Hellman algorithm uses the private key of one party and the public key of the other to create a shared secret, which is an encrypted key that both VPN tunnel peers share. Prisma Access supports the following DH groups: Group 1 (768 bits), Group 2 (1024 bits--default), Group 5 (1536 bits), Group 14 (2048 bits), Group 19 (256-bit elliptic curve group), and Group 20 (384-bit elliptic curve group). For the strongest security, select the group with the highest number.
2. Specify the authentication algorithm used in the IKE SA negotiation. Prisma Access supports the following authentication algorithms: sha1 (160 bits), sha256 (256 bits), sha384 (384 bits), sha512 (512 bits), and md5 (128 bits). You can also select null (no authentication).
3. Specify the encryption algorithm used in the IKE SA negotiation. Prisma Access supports the following encryption algorithms: 3des (168 bits), aes-128-cbc (128 bits), aes-192-cbc (192 bits), aes-256-cbc (256 bits), and des (56 bits). You can also select null (no encryption).

 2019 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

4. In the Key Lifetime field, specify the unit and amount of time for which the IKE Phase 1 key is valid (default is 8 hours). For IKEv1, the security association (SA) is not actively re-keyed before the key lifetime expires. The IKEv1 Phase 1 re-key triggers only when the SA expires. For IKEv2, the SA must be re-keyed before the key lifetime expires. If the SA is not re-keyed upon expiration, the SA must begin a new Phase 1 key.
5. Specify the IKEv2 Authentication Multiple value that is multiplied by the key lifetime to determine the authentication count (range is 0 to 50; default is 0). The authentication count is the number of times that the security processing node can perform IKEv2 IKE SA re-key before it must start over with IKEv2 re-authentication. The default value of 0 disables the re-authentication feature.
6. Save the configuration to return to the Remote Networks configuration summary. STEP 11 | (Optional) Customize the IPSec crypto profile to define how data is secured within the tunnel
when Auto Key IKE automatically generates keys for the IKE SAs during IKE Phase 2. Prisma Access automatically configures a default IPSec crypto profile based on the IPSec Device Type vendor you selected when you onboarded the branch. You can either use the default profile or create a custom profile. 1. Specify whether you want to Use Recommended Setup, which enables Prisma Access to
automatically identify the recommended IPSec crypto settings for you, or Customize Setup, which enables you to define your own IPSec crypto settings. If you Customize Setup, you must configure the following IPSec crypto settings:
1. Select an IPSec Protocol to secure the data that traverses the VPN tunnel. The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) protocol encrypts the data, authenticates the source, and verifies the data integrity. The Authentication Header (AH) protocol authenticates the source and verifies the data integrity.
2. (ESP protocol only) Specify the encryption algorithm used in the IPSec SA negotiation. Prisma Access supports the following encryption algorithms: aes-256-gcm (256 bits), aes-256-cbc (256 bits), aes-192-cbc (192 bits), aes-128-gcm (128 bits), aes-128-cbc (128 bits), 3des (168 bits), and des (56 bits). You can also select null (no encryption).
3. Specify the authentication algorithm used in the IPSec SA negotiation.
70 PRISMA ACCESS ADMINISTRATOR'S GUIDE (CLOUD MANAGED) | Secure Remote Networks with
Prisma Access

Prisma Access supports the following authentication algorithms: sha1 (160 bits), sha256 (256 bits), sha384 (384 bits), sha512 (512 bits), and md5 (128 bits). If you set the IPSec Protocol to ESP, you can also select none (no authentication). 4. Specify the Diffie-Hellman (DH) groups for IKE in the IPSec security association (SA) negotiation. Prisma Access supports the following DH groups: Group 1 (768 bits), Group 2 (1024 bits--default), Group 5 (1536 bits), Group 14 (2048 bits), Group 19 (256-bit elliptic curve group), and Group 20 (384-bit elliptic curve group). For the strongest security, select the group with the highest number. If you don't want to renew the key that Prisma Access creates during IKE phase 1, select no-pfs (no perfect forward secrecy). If you select this option, Prisma Access reuses the current key for the IPSec SA negotiation. 5. In the Lifetime field, specify the unit and amount of time during which the negotiated key is valid (default is one hour). 6. In the Lifesize field, specify the unit and amount of data that the key can use for encryption. 7. Save the configuration to return to the Remote Networks configuration summary.

Set Up a Secondary IPSec Tunnel for Your Remote Network
If the primary IPSec tunnel for your remote network goes down, the remote network falls back to the secondary IPSec tunnel until the primary IPSec tunnel comes back up. If both the primary and secondary IPSec tunnels are up, the primary IPSec tunnel takes priority over the secondary IPSec tunnel. Use the following steps to set up a secondary IPSec tunnel for your remote network: STEP 1 | From your Remote Networks configuration summary (Configure > Remote Networks >
<remote-network-config>), Set Up an IPSec secondary tunnel from the remote site.
STEP 2 | Repeat the steps for configuring the primary IPSec tunnel configuration to configure your secondary IPSec tunnel.
STEP 3 | When you finish configuring the secondary IPSec tunnel, click Save.

Enable Routing and QoS for Your Remote Network
In order for Prisma Access to route traffic to your remote networks, you must provide routing information for the subnetworks that you want to secure using Prisma Access. You can do this in several ways. You can either define a static route to each subnetwork at the remote network location, or configure BGP between your service connection locations and Prisma Access, or use a combination of both methods. If you configure both static routes and enable BGP, the static routes take precedence. While it might be convenient to use static routes if you have just a few subnetworks at your remote network locations, in a large deployment with many remote networks with overlapping subnets, BGP will enable you to scale more easily. Optionally, configure QoS to prioritize business-critical traffic or traffic that requires low latency.
Static Routes--To enable static routes to and from your remote site to Prisma Access, identify the subnetworks and/or individual IP addresses at the remote site that you want Prisma Access to secure (for both inbound and outbound traffic). The subnetworks at each branch site much not overlap with each other, with the IP pools that you designated for Prisma Access for Users, or with the infrastructure subnet. BGP--If you want to enable BGP to dynamically route traffic to and from your remote network, you will need to provide the BGP information for the eBGP router at your branch:
Branch Router Autonomous System (AS) Number--The AS to which the eBGP router at the remote network belongs. This is called the Peer AS. Router ID--The IP address assigned as the Router ID of the eBGP router on the remote network. This is called the Peer Address. If you configure both static routes and BGP routing, the static routes take precedence. QoS--If you plan to configure Prisma Access security policy rules to apply QoS markings to ingress traffic or you have a device at your branch that marks ingress traffic, you can shape the traffic egressing the remote network by defining a QoS profile that maps the classes you use to maximum and guaranteed bandwidth values. When you onboard the branch, you must select an existing QoS profile or create a new QoS profile. Use the following steps to configure routing and QoS settings for your remote network: STEP 1 | From your Remote Networks configuration summary (Configure > Remote Networks > <remote-network-config>), and Edit Routing and QoS.
PRISMA ACCESS ADMINISTRATOR'S GUIDE (CLOUD MANAGED) | Secure Remote Networks with Prisma Access 73
 2019 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

STEP 2 | Configure static routes. If you are using static routes to route traffic and from your branch, Add the IP Subnets or IP addresses that you want to secure at the branch. Note that if you make any changes to the IP subnets on your branch, you must manually update the static routes. If you are using BGP for dynamic routing in Prisma Access, you may also want to add static routes
STEP 3 | Configure dynamic routing. To use dynamic routing to advertise your branch subnets, Enable BGP and then configure the following settings: 1. To prevent Prisma Access from forwarding routes into your remote network, select Don't export routes. By default, Prisma Access advertises all BGP routing information, including local routes and all prefixes it receives from other service connections, remote networks, and mobile user subnets. Select this check box to prevent Prisma Access from sending any BGP advertisements, but still use the BGP information it receives to learn routes from other BGP neighbors.
74 PRISMA ACCESS ADMINISTRATOR'S GUIDE (CLOUD MANAGED) | Secure Remote Networks with
Prisma Access
 2019 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

Because Prisma Access does not send BGP advertisements, if you select this option you must configure static routes on your on-premise equipment to establish routes back to Prisma Access. 2. Enter the Peer AS, which is the autonomous system (AS) for your network. You must use an RFC 6696-compliant BGP Private AS number. 3. Enter the Peer IP Address assigned as the Router ID of the eBGP router on the remote network. 4. Enter the IP address that Prisma Access uses as its Local IP Address for BGP. A local address is only required if your branch device requires it for BGP peering to be successful. Make sure the address you specify does not conflict or overlap with IP addresses in the infrastructure subnet or subnets in the remote network. 5. Enter a Secret password to authenticate BGP peer communications and then Confirm Secret.
STEP 4 | (Optional) Configure a QoS profile that defines QoS classes needed to shape traffic for this branch network. You will also need to create a QoS policy rule and assign the QoS profile to in order to enforce QoS on matching branch traffic. 1. From the QoS Profile drop down, select Add QoS Profile.
2. Enter a Name to identify the QoS profile. 3. Set the bandwidth limits for the QoS profile:
 Set the maximum throughput (in Mbps) for traffic leaving the remote network connection as the Egress Max. You can specify a value up to the maximum licensed bandwidth of your remote network connection.
 Set the guaranteed bandwidth as the Egress Guaranteed (in Mbps). Any traffic that exceeds the Egress Guaranteed value is best effort but not guaranteed. Any bandwidth that is guaranteed but unused remains available to all traffic.
4. Add the QoS Classes that you want to assign to this profile. A QoS class determines the priority and bandwidth for traffic matching a QoS policy rule. You can use a QoS profile rule to define QoS classes. There are up to eight definable QoS classes in a single QoS profile. Unless otherwise configured, traffic that does not match a QoS class is assigned a class of 4.
5. Select a QoS Class and set the Priority for the QoS class (low priority, medium priority, high priority, or real-time).
PRISMA ACCESS ADMINISTRATOR'S GUIDE (CLOUD MANAGED) | Secure Remote Networks with Prisma Access 75
 2019 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

6. Set the Egress Max and Egress Guaranteed values for the QoS class. The Egress Max value for the QoS class must not exceed the Egress Max value for the QoS profile. In addition, the guaranteed bandwidth assigned to the QoS class is not reserved for that class; unused bandwidth remains available to all traffic. Any class traffic that exceeds the Egress Guaranteed value is best effort but not guaranteed.
7. Repeat these steps to Add additional classes.
8. Save the QoS profile. STEP 5 | Save the routing and QoS configuration.

Enable SSL Decryption on the Remote Network
Prisma Access makes it easy for you to decrypt traffic by providing a default SSL decryption policy based on best practices and a default set of certificates to use for SSL decryption. It is important to decrypt traffic because you cannot protect against threats you cannot see. With decryption enabled, you prevent malicious encrypted content from entering your network and sensitive content from leaving your network concealed as encrypted traffic.
If you have already configured SSL decryption for your mobile user configuration, you do not need to configure it again. You can either use the default SSL decryption policy and certificates, or customize the SSL decryption settings. STEP 1 | From your Remote Networks configuration summary (Configure > Remote Networks > <remote-network-config>) and Edit SSL Decryption.
STEP 2 | To enable SSL decryption using custom decryption policy rules and certificates: 1. Click Manage SSL decryption rules.

Manage the Prisma Access Service Infrastructure
To set up your service infrastructure in the cloud for your remote network locations and mobile users, you must provide a subnet that does not overlap with other IP addresses that you use internally. Prisma Access uses the IP addresses within this subnet to establish a network infrastructure between your remote network locations and mobile users, and from your service connections to your headquarters and/or data center (if applicable). This infrastructure enables Prisma Access to determine the service routes for services such as DNS, as well as enable other inter-service communication. Because a large number of IP addresses are required to set up the infrastructure, you must use a /24 subnet (for example, 172.16.55.0/24). This subnetwork is an extension of your existing network, and therefore, cannot overlap with any IP subnets that you use within your corporate network or with the IP address pools that you assign to your Prisma Access for users deployment. > Set Up the Prisma Access Service Infrastructure > Retrieve the IP Addresses to Whitelist for Prisma Access

Set Up the Prisma Access Service Infrastructure
To enable communication between your remote network locations, mobile users, and the HQ or data centers that you plan on connecting to Prisma Access over service connections, you must set up the service infrastructure subnet, which Prisma Access will use to create the network backbone for communication between your branch networks, mobile users and the Prisma Access security infrastructure, as well as with the HQ and data center networks you plan to connect to Prisma Access over service connections. If you use dynamic routing for your remote networks or service connections, you must also configure an RFC 6696compliant BGP Private AS number. Use the following recommendations and requirements when you add an infrastructure subnet for Prisma Access:
Use an RFC 1918-compliant subnet. While the use of non-RFC 1918-compliant (public) IP addresses is supported, it is not recommend because of possible conflicts with the internet public IP address space. Do not specify any subnets that overlap with the 100.64.0.0/15 and 169.254.0.0/16 subnet ranges because Prisma Access reserves those subnets for internal use. This subnetwork is an extension to your existing network and therefore, cannot overlap with any IP subnets that you use within your corporate network or with the IP address pools that you assign for Prisma Access for users or Prisma Access for networks. Because the service infrastructure requires a large number of IP addresses, you must designate a /24 subnetwork (for example, 172.16.55.0/24). STEP 1 | Launch Prisma Access Cloud Management. STEP 2 | Select Configure > Service Infrastructure to Configure the service infrastructure.
PRISMA ACCESS ADMINISTRATOR'S GUIDE (CLOUD MANAGED) | Manage the Prisma Access Service Infrastructure 91
 2019 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

STEP 3 | Enter an Infrastructure Subnet that Prisma Access can use to enable communication between your remote network locations, mobile users, and the HQ or data centers that you plan on connecting to Prisma Access over service connections. Use an RFC 1918-compliant subnet for the infrastructure subnet. While the use of nonRFC 1918-compliant (public) IP addresses is supported, it is not recommend because of possible conflicts with the internet public IP address space.
STEP 4 | Enter the Infrastructure BGP AS you want to use within the Prisma Access infrastructure. If you want to enable dynamic routing so that Prisma Access can dynamically discover routes to resources in your remote networks and HQ or data center locations, you must use the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). The Infrastructure BGP AS is the autonomous system (AS) number that identifies the routes through which BGP can send traffic. If you do not supply an AS number, Prisma Access uses the default AS number (65534). If you want to specify your own AS number, you must use an RFC 6996-compliant private AS number. Accepted formats are 4-Byte AS Plain [64512-65534],[4200000000-4294967294] or AS Dot [0.64512-0.65534], [64086.59904-65535.65534] notation.

STEP 5 | Save the service infrastructure settings. STEP 6 | To enable Prisma Access to resolve your internal domains, Add an Internal Domain List.
If you plan on configuring service connections to enable access to resources in your corporate network and you also need Prisma Access to resolve your internal domains, you must define the list of internal domains. DNS queries for domains in the Internal Domain List are sent to your local DNS servers to ensure that resources are available to Prisma Access remote network users and mobile users. 1. Enter the Primary DNS server and Secondary DNS server that Prisma Access should use to resolve
the internal domain names. 2. Add the internal Domain Names that you want Prisma Access to resolve.
You can use a wildcard (*) in front of the domains in the domain list, for example *.acme.local or *.acme.com.
STEP 7 | Save the internal domain list settings. STEP 8 | If you enable your users to access applications based on source IP address, you will need to get
the list of IP addresses that traffic from Prisma Access uses as the source address so that you can whitelist them in your application access policies. Copy the Egress IP API Key to enable use of the Prisma Access Egress IP Address API. Also, because the IP addresses that Prisma Access uses change periodically--for example when you add a new location, when Prisma Access needs to scale resources in an existing location, or when there is an infrastructure upgrade--you need to know when the IP addresses change so that you can update your policy rules, or automate these updates by defining a Notification URL. See Retrieve the IP Addresses to Whitelist for Prisma Access for more details. STEP 9 | Commit and push the service infrastructure configuration. Click the menu and select Commit and Push.

Retrieve the IP Addresses to Whitelist for Prisma Access
Traffic originating from your Prisma Access mobile users and users at your remote networks uses IP addresses allocated by Prisma Access. If you use security policy rules based on source IP address to enable your Prisma Access users to access internet resources (such as sanctioned SaaS applications or publiclyavailable partner applications), or applications in your corporate headquarters and data centers, you must get the IP Addresses that Prisma Access uses so that you can whitelist them. Because the IP addresses that Prisma Access uses change periodically--for example when you add a new location, when Prisma Access needs to scale resources in an existing location, or when there is an infrastructure upgrade--you need to know when the IP addresses change so that you can update your policy rules, or automate these updates. The following topics detail the types of IP addresses Prisma Access uses, how to retrieve them, and how to make sure you receive notification of IP address changes.

What IP Addresses do I Need to Whitelist?
Prisma Access uses three different types of IP addresses that you need to whitelist:
 Public IP Addresses--When a Prisma Access user (a mobile user or a user at a branch secured by Prisma Access) makes a request to access a resource on the internet, such as a sanctioned SaaS application or a publicly accessible partner application, the source IP address in the request is a public IP address from Prisma Access rather than the IP address of the end user. Therefore, if you use security policy based on source IP address to allow users secured by Prisma Access to access publicly available applications, you will need to get the list of public IP address that Prisma Access uses so that you can whitelist them in your policy rules.
There are some events that cause the list of public IP addresses that Prisma Access uses to change:
 Public IP addresses for Prisma Access for users-- With Prisma Access for mobile users, there are two sets of public IP addresses: active and reserved. Whenever the Prisma Access infrastructure upgrades, the active and reserved public IP addresses swap, and revert back after the upgrade completes. Therefore, for mobile network users you must whitelist both the active and reserved public IP addresses to ensure uninterrupted access.
 Public IP addresses for Prisma Access for networks-- With Prisma Access for remote networks, the IP addresses only change when you add a new branch to your deployment or when you increase the bandwidth at an existing branch so that the total bandwidth in the region where the branch is located surpasses 300 Mbps (either at a single branch or across multiple branches). Increasing the bandwidth in a region beyond 300 Mbps causes Prisma Access to provision an additional service IP address. Note that is only the case when you upgrade an existing remote network; if you initially provision a remote network with bandwidth over 300 Mbps, Prisma Access uses a single service IP address for the site.

 Egress IP Addresses--An egress IP address is an IP address that Prisma Access uses for egress traffic to the internet for both mobile user and remote network traffic.
All locations have public IP addresses; however, not all locations have egress IP addresses. Among other purposes, Prisma Access uses egress IP addresses so that users receive web pages in the language they expect from a Prisma Access location. Prisma Access has more than 100 locations available to accommodate worldwide deployments and provide a localized experience. Prisma Access maps each location to a compute location based on performance and latency. If you onboard more than one location that maps to the same compute location, two locations might map to the same service IP address. However, the locations might use different egress IP addresses to make sure that the user gets the correct default language for the region. For example, if you deploy two remote networks in Canada: Central Canada and Eastern Canada, both locations map to the Canada compute location, and Prisma Access assigned both locations with the same service IP address. However, because Eastern Canada uses a different default language (French) than Central Canada (English), Prisma Access assigns them different egress IP addresses. If you run the API script for egress IP addresses, you will receive two different IP addresses for these two locations.The following locations do not use egress IP addresses:
 France North  France South  Any locations that map to a single compute location (Hong Kong, Ireland, South Korea, Taiwan,
United Kingdom)  Loopback IP Addresses--When a Prisma Access user (a mobile user or a user at a branch secured by
Prisma Access) makes a request to a resource at your corporate headquarters or data center over a service connection, the source IP address in the request is a loopback IP address that Prisma Access assigns from the infrastructure subnet that you configured when you Set Up the Prisma Access Service Infrastructure. If you are using Prisma Access for users, you should whitelist the entire infrastructure subnet in security policy rules that allow access to resources on your corporate network because the loopback IP addresses change during infrastructure upgrades. If you are only using Prisma Access for networks and you enforce application access based on source IP address, you can whitelist only the service IP address that are currently in use for your existing remote networks, updating the list whenever you add a new branch.

Get your API Key and Set Up IP Address Change Notifications
Because the IP addresses Prisma Access uses can change--for example when you add a new location, when an existing location has a scaling event, or when there is an infrastructure update--you will need to update your security policy to whitelist the IP addresses Prisma Access uses. Prisma Access allows you to specify a notification URL at which you can be alerted of a change. Typically, change happens either because you onboarded or deleted a new remote network location or Prisma Access initiated a change to support the demands from your network, such as scaling out to support a surge in traffic in a specific location.
STEP 1 | Get the API key.
You need this key to authenticate to Prisma Access and retrieve the list of IP addresses using the curl command listed below.
1. Select Configure > Service Infrastructure. 2. Copy the Egress IP API Key for use in the commands for retrieving IP addresses.
PRISMA ACCESS ADMINISTRATOR'S GUIDE (CLOUD MANAGED) | Manage the Prisma Access Service Infrastructure 95
 2019 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

To ensure the security of your API key, rotate it periodically by clicking Generate New. You will then need to update the key in all of your scripts.
STEP 2 | Add an Notification URL where Prisma Access can send notification of IP address changes in your Prisma Access infrastructure. You can specify an IP address or an FQDN to an HTTP or HTTPS web service that is listening for change notifications. For example: http://mydomain/cgi-bin/test1.py. You do not need to commit your change for the notification URL. After you set up the notification URL, Prisma Access uses an HTTP POST request to send the notification. This POST request includes the following notification data in JSON format:
{"addrType": "public_ip", "addrChangeType": "add", "utc_timestamp": "2019-01-31 23:08:19.383894", "text": "Address List Change Notification"}
{"addrType": "public_ip", "addrChangeType": "delete", "utc_timestamp": "2019-01-31 23:13:35.882151", "text": "Address List Change Notification"}
{"addrType": "loopback_ip", "addrChangeType": "update", "utc_timestamp": "2019-01-31 23:29:27.100329", "text": "2018-05-11 23:29:27.100329"}
When you receive a notification, you must follow a two-step process. First, you must manually or programatically retrieve the list IP addresses. Then, you must update the IP addresses in the appropriate whitelist to ensure that users do not experience any disruption in service.
96 PRISMA ACCESS ADMINISTRATOR'S GUIDE (CLOUD MANAGED) | Manage the Prisma Access Service
Infrastructure
 2019 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

Prisma Access sends this notification a few seconds before the new IP address becomes active. Use automation scripts to both retrieve and whitelist the new IP addresses.
Retrieve IP Addresses for Mobile User Deployments
Prisma Access provides two sets of public IP and egress IP addresses so that it can automatically add locations during a scaling or other event (for example, when a large number of mobile users join a single gateway):  One set that is assigned to Prisma Access locations that are currently active.  Another set to reserve in case of a scaling event, infrastructure upgrade, or other event that causes
Prisma Access to add locations or scale out in an existing location. If you are enabling application access based on source IP address, to ensure that your mobile users can always access the resources they need whitelist the entire set of IP addresses (including the reserved addresses). If you do not want to whitelist the entire list of IP addresses, you can instead get the list of active IP addresses only. STEP 1 | Get your API Key and Set Up IP Address Change Notifications.
STEP 2 | If you want to retrieve all mobile user public IP and egress IP addresses, including IP addresses that are reserved for a scaling event and are not currently active use the following command:
curl -k -H header-api-key:Current-API-Key "https://api.gpcloudservice.com/ getAddrList/latest?get_egress_ip_all=yes"
Where Current-API-Key is the Prisma Access API key. For example, given an API key of 12345abcde, use the following API command to retrieve the public IP address for all locations:
curl -k -H header-api-key:12345abcde "https://api.gpcloudservice.com/ getAddrList/latest?get_egress_ip_all=yes"
If you think that Prisma Access has used the reserved set of public IP addresses (for example, if a large number of mobile users have accessed a single location), you can run this API command again to find the new set of reserved public IP addresses. All IP addresses persist after an upgrade.
STEP 3 | If you want to retrieve only the currently active public IP, egress IP, and/or loopback IP addresses used in your mobile user deployment, run the following commands: Use the API key and the API endpoint URL either manually or in an automation script:
header-api-key:Current API Key "https://api.gpcloudservice.com/getAddrList/latest? fwType=&fwType&addrType=$addrType"
where you need to replace Current API Key with your API key and use the following keywords and arguments:
PRISMA ACCESS ADMINISTRATOR'S GUIDE (CLOUD MANAGED) | Manage the Prisma Access Service Infrastructure 97

For mobile user locations, Prisma Access lists the IP addresses by location.

loopback_ip

Retrieves the source IP addresses used by Prisma Access for requests made to internal resources, and is assigned from the service infrastructure IP address pool.

If you don't specify the addrType keyword, Prisma Access retrieves all currently active public IP addresses, egress IP addresses, and loopback IP addresses. For example, use the following Curl command to manually retrieve the list of active IP addresses for your mobile user deployment you would run the following commands:
curl -k -H header-api-key:12345abcde "https://api.gpcloudservice.com/ getAddrList/latest?fwType=gpcs_gw"

STEP 4 | Update the whitelists on your on-premises servers or SaaS application policy rules with the IP addresses you retrieved.
Retrieve IP Addresses for Your Remote Networks
You can retrieve the list of source IP addresses that Prisma Access uses for the traffic to the internet, to SaaS applications, or to your internal services using the Prisma Access Egress IP APIs. You will need to get this list if you whitelist access to applications and services based on Source IP to ensure that users at your remote networks can always access the resources they need.
For remote networks, the public or egress IP address might be different from the Service IP Address. Prisma Access maps each remote network location to a compute location based on performance and latency. If you onboard more than one location that maps to the same compute location, two locations might map to the same service IP address. However, the locations might use different egress IP addresses to make sure that the user gets the correct default language for the region.
STEP 1 | Get your API Key and Set Up IP Address Change Notifications.
STEP 2 | Retrieve the public IP addresses, egress IP addresses, and/or loopback IP addresses, for the remote networks you have deployed.
Use the API key and the API endpoint URL either manually or in an automation script:
header-api-key:Current API Key "https://api.gpcloudservice.com/getAddrList/latest? fwType=gpcs_remote_network&addrType=$addrType"
where you need to replace Current API Key with your API key and use one of the following arguments for the $addrType keyword, or retrieve all address types, do not include this keyword:

Plan Your Service Connection
Create service connections to allow Prisma Access to perform the following tasks:  Allow access to the resources in your HQ or data center.
If you have corporate resources that your remote networks and mobile users need to access, you must enable Prisma Access to access the corresponding corporate network.  Allow remote networks and mobile users to communicate with each other. Even if you do not need your Prisma Access users to connect to your HQ or data center, you might need to allow your mobile users to access your remote network locations. Service connections are required for this use case because, while all remote network connections are fully meshed, the mobile user infrastructure is not. Minimally configuring a service connections establishes the hub-and-spoke network mobile users need to access a branch network.
To improve network efficiency, place service connections close to the remote network or networks that mobile users access most frequently.
Your Prisma Access for users license includes the option to establish service connections to up to three of your headquarters and/or data centers; your Prisma Access for networks license includes the option to establish service connections to up to 100 sites. The first three service connections for your Prisma Access networks license are included with no license cost; each subsequent connection uses 300 Mbps of your licensed remote networks bandwidth pool. Prisma Access does not limit the bandwidth over these connections. Before you begin to configure Prisma Access service connections, gather the following information for each of your HQ or data centers to which you want Prisma Access to be able to connect:
This checklist is only required if you are setting up a service connection to access resources in your HQ or data center. If you are creating a service connection only to allow mobile users to access remote network locations, you do not need to gather this information.
IPSec-capable firewall, router, or SD-WAN device connection at your corporate site. IPSec settings for terminating the primary VPN tunnel from Prisma Access to the IPSec-capable device on your corporate network. IPSec settings for terminating the secondary VPN tunnel from Prisma Access to the IPSec-capable device on your corporate network. List of IP subnetworks at the site. List of internal domains that Prisma Access must be able to resolve. IP address of a corporate access node at your network's site to which Prisma Access can send ICMP ping requests for IPSec tunnel monitoring. Make sure that this address is reachable by ICMP from the entire Prisma Access infrastructure subnet. Network reachability settings for the service infrastructure subnet. Make the entire service infrastructure subnet reachable from the HQ or data center. Prisma Access uses IP addresses for all control plane traffic from this subnet.

STEP 4 | Name the site. STEP 5 | Select the Location where your HQ or data center is located. STEP 6 | Select the IPSec Device Type that you are using at your site to establish an IPSec tunnel with
Prisma Access. Based on the device type you select, Prisma Access automatically populates default IKE crypto and IPSec crypto settings so that you don't have to configure them when you set up your IPSec tunnel(s). STEP 7 | Click Next to Set Up a Primary IPSec Tunnel for Your Service Connection.
Set Up a Primary IPSec Tunnel for Your Service Connection
Use the following steps to set up a primary IPSec tunnel for your service connection: STEP 1 | Launch Prisma Access Cloud Management. STEP 2 | Start from the Configure > Service Connections > IPSec Peer Authentication.

 2019 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

 If you just finished the steps to Onboard a Service Connection, clicking Next takes you to this page automatically.
 If you've already onboarded your HQ or data center network, select Configure > Service Connections and then select your service connection and click to Set Up or Edit IPSec Peer Authentication.
STEP 3 | Select an IKE Protocol Version for the IPSec device at your HQ or data center site and Prisma Access to use for IKE negotiation. If you select IKEv1 Only Mode, Prisma Access can use only the IKEv1 protocol for the negotiation. If you select IKEv2 Only Mode, Prisma Access can use only the IKEv2 protocol for the negotiation. If you select IKEv2 Preferred Mode, Prisma Access uses the IKEv2 protocol only if your site device also supports IKEv2. If your does not support IKEv2, Prisma Access falls back to using the IKEv1 protocol.
STEP 4 | Enter the Pre-Shared Key that your on-premise device and Prisma Access to will use to authenticate each other and then Confirm Pre-Shared Key.
STEP 5 | For Peer IP Address Type, specify whether you want to use a Static IP Address or a Dynamic IP Address to identify the tunnel endpoint.  Static IP Address--If you select this option, enter the Static IP Address on your on-premise device to use as the endpoint for the IPSec tunnel.  Dynamic IP Address--If you select this option, you must enable either HQ/DC IKE ID or Prisma Access IKE ID and then supply the Identification Type and the corresponding Identifier. Because you do not have the values to use for the Prisma Access IKE ID until the service connection is fully deployed, you would typically want to set the HQ/DC IKE ID rather than the Prisma Access IKE ID. If you want to supply a Prisma Access IKE ID for additional peer validation, after the service connection is deployed, enable Prisma Access IKE ID and then select the Identification Type you want to use to identify the Prisma Access IPSec device. You can find the Service IP for the Prisma Access peer on the Service Connections summary page (Configure > Service Connections), which you can use as the IKE ID.

STEP 8 | Enter a Tunnel Monitoring IP Address on the HQ or data center network for Prisma Access to use determine whether the tunnel is up and, if your on-premise IPSec device uses policy-based VPN, enter an associated Proxy ID.
STEP 9 | Save the tunnel settings. STEP 10 | (Optional) Customize the IKE crypto settings used to define the encryption and authentication
algorithms used for the key exchange process in IKE Phase 1. Prisma Access automatically configures a default IKE crypto profile based on the IPSec Device Type you selected when you Onboard a Service Connection. You can either use the default profile or create a custom profile. 1. Specify whether you want to Use Recommended Setup, which enables Prisma Access to
automatically identify the recommended IKE crypto settings for you, or Customize Setup, which enables you to define your own IKE crypto settings. If you Customize Setup, you must configure the following IKE crypto settings:
1. Specify the Diffie-Hellman (DH) groups used to generate symmetrical keys for IKE in the IKE SA negotiation. The Diffie-Hellman algorithm uses the private key of one party and the public key of the other to create a shared secret, which is an encrypted key that both VPN tunnel peers share. Prisma Access supports the following DH groups: Group 1 (768 bits), Group 2 (1024 bits--default), Group 5 (1536 bits), Group 14 (2048 bits), Group 19 (256-bit elliptic curve group), and Group 20 (384-bit elliptic curve group). For the strongest security, select the group with the highest number.
2. Specify the authentication algorithm used in the IKE SA negotiation. Prisma Access supports the following authentication algorithms: sha1 (160 bits), sha256 (256 bits), sha384 (384 bits), sha512 (512 bits), and md5 (128 bits). You can also select null (no authentication).
3. Specify the encryption algorithm used in the IKE SA negotiation. Prisma Access supports the following encryption algorithms: 3des (168 bits), aes-128-cbc (128 bits), aes-192-cbc (192 bits), aes-256-cbc (256 bits), and des (56 bits). You can also select null (no encryption).
4. In the Key Lifetime field, specify the unit and amount of time for which the IKE Phase 1 key is valid (default is 8 hours). For IKEv1, the security association (SA) is not actively re-keyed before
108 PRISMA ACCESS ADMINISTRATOR'S GUIDE (CLOUD MANAGED) | Manage Prisma Access Service
Connections
 2019 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

the key lifetime expires. The IKEv1 Phase 1 re-key triggers only when the SA expires. For IKEv2, the SA must be re-keyed before the key lifetime expires. If the SA is not re-keyed upon expiration, the SA must begin a new Phase 1 key. 5. Specify the IKEv2 Authentication Multiple value that is multiplied by the key lifetime to determine the authentication count (range is 0 to 50; default is 0). The authentication count is the number of times that the security processing node can perform IKEv2 IKE SA re-key before it must start over with IKEv2 re-authentication. The default value of 0 disables the re-authentication feature. 6. Save the configuration to return to the Service Connections configuration summary. STEP 11 | (Optional) Set up an IPSec crypto profile to define how data is secured within the tunnel when Auto Key IKE automatically generates keys for the IKE SAs during IKE Phase 2. Prisma Access automatically configures a default IPSec crypto profile based on the IPSec Device Type vendor you selected when you onboarded the branch. You can either use the default profile or create a custom profile. 1. Specify whether you want to Use Recommended Setup, which enables Prisma Access to automatically identify the recommended IPSec crypto settings for you, or Customize Setup, which enables you to define your own IPSec crypto settings. If you Customize Setup, you must configure the following IPSec crypto settings:
1. Select an IPSec Protocol to secure the data that traverses the VPN tunnel. The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) protocol encrypts the data, authenticates the source, and verifies the data integrity. The Authentication Header (AH) protocol authenticates the source and verifies the data integrity.
2. (ESP protocol only) Specify the encryption algorithm used in the IPSec SA negotiation. Prisma Access supports the following encryption algorithms: aes-256-gcm (256 bits), aes-256-cbc (256 bits), aes-192-cbc (192 bits), aes-128-gcm (128 bits), aes-128-cbc (128 bits), 3des (168 bits), and des (56 bits). You can also select null (no encryption).
3. Specify the authentication algorithm used in the IPSec SA negotiation. Prisma Access supports the following authentication algorithms: sha1 (160 bits), sha256 (256 bits), sha384 (384 bits), sha512 (512 bits), and md5 (128 bits). If you set the IPSec Protocol to ESP, you can also select none (no authentication).
4. Specify the Diffie-Hellman (DH) groups for IKE in the IPSec security association (SA) negotiation.
PRISMA ACCESS ADMINISTRATOR'S GUIDE (CLOUD MANAGED) | Manage Prisma Access Service Connections 109

Prisma Access supports the following DH groups: Group 1 (768 bits), Group 2 (1024 bits--default), Group 5 (1536 bits), Group 14 (2048 bits), Group 19 (256-bit elliptic curve group), and Group 20 (384-bit elliptic curve group). For the strongest security, select the group with the highest number. If you don't want to renew the key that Prisma Access creates during IKE phase 1, select no-pfs (no perfect forward secrecy). If you select this option, Prisma Access reuses the current key for the IPSec SA negotiation. 5. In the Lifetime field, specify the unit and amount of time during which the negotiated key is valid (default is one hour). 6. In the Lifesize field, specify the unit and amount of data that the key can use for encryption. 7. Save the configuration to return to the Service Connections configuration summary.
Set Up a Secondary IPSec Tunnel for Your Service Connection
If the primary IPSec tunnel for your service connection goes down, the service connection falls back to the secondary IPSec tunnel until the primary IPSec tunnel comes back up. If both the primary and secondary IPSec tunnels are up, the primary IPSec tunnel takes priority over the secondary IPSec tunnel. Use the following steps to set up a secondary IPSec tunnel for your service connection: STEP 1 | From your Service Connections configuration summary (Configure > Service Connections >
<service-connection-config>) and Set Up or Edit the Secondary tunnel configuration.
STEP 2 | Repeat the steps for configuring the primary IPSec tunnel to configure your secondary IPSec tunnel.
STEP 3 | When you finish configuring the secondary IPSec tunnel, click Save.
Enable Routing and Quality of Service for Your Service Connection
Enable routing to the subnetworks or individual IP addresses on your HQ or data center network that your Prisma Access users will need access to. Prisma Access uses this information to route requests to the appropriate site. The networks at each site cannot overlap with each other or with IP address pools that you designated for the service infrastructure or for the Prisma Access for users IP pools. You can configure Static Routes, BGP, or a combination of both.

STEP 3 | Configure dynamic routing. To use dynamic routing to advertise your HQ or data center, Enable BGP and then configure the following settings: 1. To prevent Prisma Access from forwarding routes into your HQ or data center, select Don't export routes. By default, Prisma Access advertises all BGP routing information, including local routes and all prefixes it receives from other service connections, remote networks, and mobile user subnets. Select this check box to prevent Prisma Access from sending any BGP advertisements, but still use the BGP information it receives to learn routes from other BGP neighbors. 2. Enter the Peer AS, which is the autonomous system (AS) for your network. You must use an RFC 6696-compliant BGP Private AS number. 3. Enter the Peer IP Address assigned as the Router ID of the eBGP router on your HQ or data center network. 4. Enter the IP address that Prisma Access uses as its Local IP Address for BGP.

A local address is only required if your on-premise device requires it for BGP peering to be successful. Make sure the address you specify does not conflict or overlap with IP addresses in the infrastructure subnet or subnets in the remote network. 5. Enter a Secret password to authenticate BGP peer communications and then Confirm Secret.
STEP 4 | (Optional) Configure a QoS profile that defines QoS classes needed to shape traffic for this HQ or data center network. You will also need to create a QoS policy rule and assign the QoS profile to in order to enforce QoS on matching traffic to or from your data center. 1. From the QoS Profile drop down, select Add QoS Profile.
2. Enter a Name to identify the QoS profile. 3. Set the bandwidth limits for the QoS profile:
 Set the maximum throughput (in Mbps) for traffic leaving the service connection as the Egress Max. For service connections, specify a number of up to 1 Gpbs (1,000 Mbps).
 Set the guaranteed bandwidth as the Egress Guaranteed (in Mbps). Any traffic that exceeds the Egress Guaranteed value is best effort but not guaranteed. Any bandwidth that is guaranteed but unused remains available to all traffic.
4. Add the QoS Classes that you want to assign to this profile. A QoS class determines the priority and bandwidth for traffic matching a QoS policy rule. You can use a QoS profile rule to define QoS classes. There are up to eight definable QoS classes in a single QoS profile. Unless otherwise configured, traffic that does not match a QoS class is assigned a class of 4.
5. Select a QoS Class and set the Priority for the QoS class (low priority, medium priority, high priority, or real-time).
6. Set the Egress Max and Egress Guaranteed values for the QoS class. The Egress Max value for the QoS class must not exceed the Egress Max value for the QoS profile. In addition, the guaranteed bandwidth assigned to the QoS class is not reserved for that class; unused bandwidth remains available to all traffic. Any class traffic that exceeds the Egress Guaranteed value is best effort but not guaranteed.
7. Repeat these steps to Add additional classes.

Organize your Prisma Access Configurations
Use the default configuration groups in Prisma Access to organize the common Prisma Access configurations, and those which are specific to your remote networks, mobile users, and service connections. This enables you to organize your configurations based on common policy requirements without redundant configurations. When configuring a Prisma Access policy or object, use the drop-down as pictured below to select the appropriate configuration group for the policy or object you are configuring. By default, Prisma Access includes four configuration groups, and additional groups cannot be created:  Prisma Access Common--Parent configuration group. In this group, configure policies and objects that
are shared across your remote networks, mobile users, and service connections. The configurations that are part of this group take precedence over those in the Remote Networks, Mobile Users and Service Connection groups.  Remote Networks--Child configuration group. In this group, configure policies and objects that are specific to your on-boarded remote networks. Policies and objects configured in the Mobile Users or Service Connections groups have no impact on your remote network configuration.  Mobile Users--Child configuration group. In this group, configure policies and objects that are specific to your on-boarded mobile users. Policies and objects configured in the Remote Networks or Service Connections groups have no impact on your mobile users configuration.  Service Connections--Child configuration group. In this group, configure policies and objects that are specific to your on-boarded service connections. Policies and objects configured in the Remote Networks or Mobile Users groups have no impact on your service connection configuration.

Prisma Access Policy Types
The different policy types supported on Prisma Access are: Security (Corporate Access and Internet Access), QoS, Decryption, Application Override, and Authentication.

Policy Type

Description

Security

Determine whether to block or allow sessions based on the traffic attributes such as the source and destination zones, the source and destination IP addresses, the application, or user. See Create a Security Policy Rule.

QoS

Identify traffic requiring quality of service treatment, such as preferential

treatment using a defined parameter or multiple parameters and assign it a

class. See Create a QoS Policy Rule.

Decryption

Identify encrypted traffic that you want to inspect for visibility, control, and granular security. See Create a Decryption Policy Rule.

Application Override

Identify sessions that you do not want processed by the App-ID engine which is a Layer-7 inspection. Traffic matching an application override policy forces Prisma Access to handle the session as a regular stateful inspection at Layer-4. See Create an Application Override Policy Rule.

Prisma Access Policy
Policies enable you to enforce rules and take action when traffic matches a Prisma Access policy rule or when Prisma Access identifies suspicious activity on your network. By default, basic internet access policy rules are created when you onboard new mobile users. This allows you to quickly set up Prisma Access and deploy Palo Alto Networks recommended protection to your end points. More granular policy rules need to be created or to enable access to your corporate network over service connections for example, to address your specific business needs.
PRISMA ACCESS ADMINISTRATOR'S GUIDE (CLOUD MANAGED) | Create Prisma Access Policy 123
 2019 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

Prisma Access Zones
Traffic must pass through Prisma Access in order to manage and control it using policy rules and zones. When creating a policy rule, you must designate specific zones that the rule applies to. For example, because traffic can only flow between zones, you need a security policy to allow the traffic from the source zone to the destination zone. Prisma Access simplifies creating policy rules by automatically setting up your network infrastructure for you. This means that you no longer need to configure the zones you use create policy rules. Instead, Prisma Access automatically configures three zones that you use to build your network security.
Prisma Access supports three zones:

Zone Trust Untrust
Clientless VPN

Description
Zone containing all trusted and on-boarded IP addresses, service connections, or mobile users within the corporate network.
All untrusted IP addresses, service connections, or mobile users outside of the corporate network. By default, any IP address or mobile user that is not trusted is inherently untrusted.
Secure remote access to common enterprise web applications that use HTML, HTML5, and Javascript technologies. Users have the advantage of secure access from SSL-enabled web browsers without installing client software. This is useful when you need to enable partner or contractor access to applications, and to safely enable unmanaged assets, including personal devices..

Prisma Access Objects
Prisma Access objects are a single unit, or collective unit that groups IP addresses, applications, services, HIP objects, or security profiles. You reference objects when creating a policy rule, and in the case of policy objects that are a collective unit, you can reference that single object rather than manually selecting multiple individual objects to simplifying the policy definition.
When you create a policy object, it is a best practice to group objects that require similar permissions in the policy. For example, if your organization uses a set of destination IP addresses to that require the same policy enforcement, you can group them as address objects in an address group and reference that address group in your policy. You can create the following policy objects in Prisma Access:

Object Addresses, Address Groups, Regions
Applications, Application Groups, Application Filters
Services, Service Groups
Tags
HIP Objects, HIP Profiles

Description
Allows you to group specific source or destination addresses that require the same policy enforcement. Address objects can include IPv4 and IPv6 address (single IP, range, subnet), or FQDN. Alternatively, you may define a region by the latitude and longitude coordinates or you can select a country and define an IP address or range. You can then group a collection of address objects to create an address group object. See Create Address Objects.
Allows you to define applications and their risk that are in use by your organization. Additionally, you can group a collection of applications to create an Application Group that require the same policy enforcement and simplifies administration of your rulebase by allowing you to update only the affected application group, rather than multiple policy rules, when there is a change of applications you support.
Create an Application Filter to dynamically group applications based on application attributes that you define. This is useful when you want to safely enable access to applications that you do not explicitly sanction, but want users to be able to access. See Create Application Objects.
Allows you to specify the source and destination ports and protocols that a service can use. You also create an custom service on any TCP/UDP port of your choice to restrict application usage to specific ports on your network. After you have created your service objects, you can then group a collection of services to create a Service Group that require the same policy enforcement. See Create Service Objects.
Create tags to visually group objects using keywords or phrases. You can apply tags to address objects, address groups, services, service groups, and policy rules. See Use Tags to Group and Visually Distinguish Policies and Objects.
Allows you to define objects for the host information profile (HIP) to provide matching criteria for filtering the raw data which gives information about how the device is maintained. This information includes whether data is encrypted, if antivirus signatures are up to date, if the device is jailbroken and more. You can use the device state information to enforce policy. After you have created your HIP objects, you can then group a collection of HIP objects to create a HIP Profile to be evaluated together for monitoring or for policy enforcement. See Create HIP Objects.

Object External Dynamic Lists URL Category Security Profiles
Security Profile Group

Description
Allows you to define an imported list of IP addresses, URLs, or domain names that you can use in policy rules to block or allow traffic. See External Dynamic List in Prisma Access.
Allows you to create a custom URL category object to use in a URL Filtering profile to specify exceptions to URL category enforcement, and to create a custom URL category based on multiple URL categories. See Create a URL Category Object.
Allows you to create security profiles that instruct Prisma Access to scan applications for threats when attached to a policy rule. When traffic matches the rule defined the policy, the security profile(s) that are attached to the rule are applied for further content inspection. You can create the following security profiles:
 Vulnerability Protection  URL Filtering  File Blocking  WildFire Analysis
The following security profiles have pre-populated default and best practice profiles. Additional profiles cannot be created:
 Antivirus  Anti-Spyware  Decryption
See Create a Security Profile.
A security profile group is a set of security profiles that are treated as a single unit and then easily added to security policy rules. Add individual security profiles that are often assigned together to profile groups to simplify the creation of security policies. See Create a Security Profile Group.

Create Address Objects
Create one or more address objects, address groups, or region to group specific source or destination addresses that require the same policy enforcement.  Create an Address Object  Create an Address Group  Create a Region Object
Create an Address Object

When you have multiple signatures added to an application object, click Move Up or Move Down to order the signatures as needed when enabled. If matching order is not important, disable (clear) the setting. 6. Specify conditions to define signatures. Add the And Condition or Or Conditions as needed. STEP 6 | Save your configuration. STEP 7 | Select Commit and Commit and Push your configuration changes.
Create an Application Group
An application group allows you to group multiple applications that you want to be treated similarly in policy. Application groups allow you to enable access to applications you explicitly sanction and simply administration of your rulebase by allowing you to update the application group with new applications, rather than updating each individual manually when new applications are introduced in your organization. When deciding how to group applications, consider how you plan to enforce access and create the application group with your policy goals in mind. For example, if there are applications that only IT administrators can access, and there are applications that any known user can access, create application groups that align with each of these policy goals. STEP 1 | Launch Prisma Access Cloud Management. STEP 2 | Create the required application objects. STEP 3 | Select Objects > Application Groups and Add a new application group. STEP 4 | Enter the address group Name. STEP 5 | Add applications to the application group. In this example, we are adding common video game

STEP 7 | Select Commit and Commit and Push your configuration changes.
Create an Application Filter
An application filter is an object that dynamically groups applications based on attributes you define. This includes the category, subcategory, technology, risk factor, and characteristics of the applications you want grouped together. As new applications emerge, and new App-IDs are introduced, these new applications are automatically matched and grouped based on the filters you defined. Application filters ease the burden of rulebase management by automatically updating application groups attributed to policy rules so that you do not need to manually edit your policy rules to include the new applications. STEP 1 | Launch Prisma Access Cloud Management. STEP 2 | Select Objects > Application Filters and Add a new application filter. STEP 3 | Enter a descriptive Name for the application filter. STEP 4 | Add attribute values from the Category, Subcategory, Technology, Risk, SaaS Certifications,

Create a Service Object
Service objects allow you to limit the port numbers an application can use when applied to policies you define for specific applications. The default service object for any policy rule is application-default where the selected applications in the policy rule are allowed or denied only on their default ports defined by Palo Alto Networks. This option is beneficial because it prevents applications from running on unusual ports and protocols which, if unintentional, can be a sign of undesired application behavior and usage. However, you can create a service object to limit application functionality to specific ports of your choosing that better align with the specific needs of your organization. STEP 1 | Launch Prisma Access Cloud Management. STEP 2 | Select Objects > Services and Add a new service object. STEP 3 | Enter a descriptive Name for the service. STEP 4 | (Optional) Enter a Description for the service. STEP 5 | Select the Protocol used by the service. STEP 6 | Enter the Destination Port for application traffic. The port can be a single port number, range

External Dynamic List in Prisma Access
An external dynamic list is a text file that you or another source host on an external web server from which Prisma Access can import IP addresses, URLs, and domains to enforce policies on the entries in the list. Prisma Access dynamically imports new entries in the external dynamic list when updated at the configured interval and enforces policy without need to make additional configuration changes.

PRISMA ACCESS ADMINISTRATOR'S GUIDE (CLOUD MANAGED) | Create Prisma Access Policy 137
 2019 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

Types of External Dynamic Lists
An External Dynamic List is a text file containing import objects--IP addresses, URLs, or domains-- from an external web server that Prisma Access can use to enforce policy. As you modify the list, Prisma Access dynamically imports the list at the configured interval and enforces policy without you needing to make any configuration changes or commit on Prisma Access. If the web server is not unreachable, Prisma Access uses the last successfully retrieved list for enforcing policy until connection to the web server is restored. but only if the list is not secured with SSL.
To enforce policy on the entries in the list, you must reference the list in a supported policy rule or profile. When you reference multiple lists, you can prioritize the order of evaluation to make sure the most important lists are committed before reaching capacity limits.
Prisma Access supports the following types of external dynamic lists:
 Predefined IP Address--A predefined IP address list is a list that refers to the built-in, dynamic IP lists with fixed or "predefined" contents. These Built-In External Dynamic Lists--for bulletproof hosting providers, known malicious, and high-risk IP addresses-- are automatically added to Prisma Access. A predefined IP address list can also refer to an EDL that uses one of the built-in lists as a source. Because you cannot modify the contents of a predefined list, you may use one as a source for a different EDL if you want to add or exclude list entries.
 IP Address--Enforce policy for a list of source or destination IP addresses that emerge ad hoc by using an external dynamic list of type IP address as the source or destination address object in policy rules and configure Prisma Access to deny or allow access to the IP addresses included in the list. Prisma Access treats an external dynamic list of type IP address as an address object, and all IP addresses included are handled as one address object.
 URL--An external dynamic list of type URL allows you to protect your network from new sources of threat or malware using URLs. You can use this list in two ways:
 As a match criteria in Security policy rules, Decryption policy rules, and QoS policy rules to allow, deny, decrypt, not decrypt, or allocate bandwidth for the URLs.
 In a URL Filtering profile where you can define more granular actions, such as continue, alert, or override, before you attach the profile to a Security policy rule.
 Domain--An external dynamic list of type domain allows you to import custom domain names to Prisma Access to enforce policy. This is very useful if you subscribe to third-party intelligence feeds and want to protect your network from new sources of threat or malware as soon as you learn of a suspicious domain. For each domain you include in the list, Prisma Access creates a custom DNS-based spyware signature so that you can enable DNS sinkholing.
Formatting Guidelines for an External Dynamic List
An external dynamic list of one type--IP address, URL, or Domain--must include entries of that type only. The entries in a predefined list comply with the formatting guidelines for IP address lists.
 IP Address List  Domain List  URL List
IP Address List
The external dynamic list can include individual IP addresses, subnet addresses (subnet/mask) or range of IP addresses. The block list can include comments and special characters such as *, :, ;, #, or /. The syntax of each line in the list is: [<IP address>, <IP/Mask>, or <IP start range>-<IP end range> [space] [<comment>].
Enter each IP address/range/subnet in a new line. URLs or domains are not supported in this list. A subnet or IP address range count as one IP address entry and not as multiple IP addresses. If you add comments,
138 PRISMA ACCESS ADMINISTRATOR'S GUIDE (CLOUD MANAGED) | Create Prisma Access Policy
 2019 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

the comments must be on the same line as the IP address/range/subnet. The space at the end of the IP address is the delimiter that separates a comment from the IP address. An example IP address list:
192.168.20.10/32 2001:db8:123:1::1 #test IPv6 address 192.168.20.0/24 ; test internal subnet 2001:db8:123:1::/64 test internal IPv6 range 192.168.20.40-192.168.20.50
For an IP address that is blocked, you can display a notification page only if the protocol is HTTP.
Domain List Follow these guidelines when creating domain list entries:  Enter each domain name in a new line; URLS or IP addresses are not supported in this list.  Do not prefix the domain name with the protocol, http://, or https://  The following characters are considered token separators: . / ? & = ; +
Every string separated by one or two of these characters is a token.  You can use a caret (^) to indicate an exact match value.
Prisma Access does not support wildcards in external dynamic list type domain.
URL List Follow these guidelines when creating URL list entries:  Enter the IP addresses or URLs of websites that you want to enforce seperately from the assocaited URL
category.  List entries must be an exact match and are case-sensitive.  Enter a string that is an exact match to the website, and possibly a specific subdomain, for which you
want to control access.  Omit http and https from URL entries.
Prisma Access does not support wildcards in external dynamic list type URL.
Built-In External Dynamic Lists
Palo Alto Networks provides built-in IP address external dynamic lists that you can use to protect against malicious attacks.  Palo Alto Networks Bulletproof IP Addresses--Contains IP addresses provided by bulletproof hosting
providers. Because bulletproof hosting providers place few, if any, restrictions on content, attackers frequently use these services to host and distribute malicious, illegal, and unethical material.  Palo Alto Networks High-Risk IP Addresses--Contains malicious IP addresses from threat advisories issued by trusted third-party organizations. Palo Alto Networks compiles the list of threat advisories, but does not have direct evidence of the maliciousness of the IP addresses.  Palo Alto Networks Known Malicious IP Addresses--Contains IP addresses that are verified malicious based on WildFire analysis, Unit 42 research, and data gathered from telemetry. Attackers use these IP addresses almost exclusively to distribute malware, initiate command-and-control activity, and launch attacks
PRISMA ACCESS ADMINISTRATOR'S GUIDE (CLOUD MANAGED) | Create Prisma Access Policy 139
 2019 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

Prisma Access receives updates for these feeds in the automatic content updates, allowing Prisma Access to automatically enforce policy based on the latest threat intelligence from Palo Alto Networks. You cannot modify the contents of the build-in lists. Use them as-is, or create a custom external dynamic list that uses one of the lists as a source and exclude entries from the list as needed.
Configure Access to an External Dynamic List
You must establish a connection between Prisma Access and the source that hosts the external dynamic list.
STEP 1 | Find an external dynamic host to use with Prisma Access.  Create an external dynamic list and host it on a web server. Enter IP addresses, domains, or urls in a blank text file. See Formatting Guidelines for an External Dynamic List for more information on the format requirements for each external dynamic list type.  Use an existing external dynamic list hosted by another source and verify that it follows the Formatting Guidelines for an External Dynamic List.
STEP 2 | Launch Prisma Access Cloud Management.
STEP 3 | Select Objects > External Dynamic Lists.
STEP 4 | Click Add and enter a descriptive Name for the list.
STEP 5 | Select the list Type. If you are using a Domain List, you can optionally enable Automatically expand to include subdomains to also include the subdomains of a specified domain. For example, if your domain list includes paloaltonetworks.com, all lower level components of the domain name (e.g., *.paloaltonetworks.com) will also be included as part of the list. Keep in mind, when you enable this setting, each domain in a given list requires an additional entry, effectively doubling the number of entries that are consumed.
STEP 6 | Enter the Source for the external dynamic list. The source must include the full path to access the list. For example, https://1.2.3.4/EDL_IP_2019 If you are creating a list of type Predefined IP, select a Palo Alto Networks malicious IP address feed to use as a source.
STEP 7 | If the source is secured with SSL (i.e lists with an HTTPs URL), select a Certificate Profile to authenticate the server that hosts the list. If a certificate profile does not exist, select Add Certificate Profile to create a new certificate profile. The certificate profile you select must have a root CA (certificate authority) and intermediate CA certificates that match the certificates installed on the server you are authenticating.
STEP 8 | Specify the Check for updates frequency at which Prisma Access retrieves the list. By default, Prisma Access retrieves the list once every hour and commits the changes. The interval is relative to the last commit. For example, for the five-minute interval, the commit occurs in five minutes if the last commit was an hour ago.
STEP 9 | (Optional) Select Exception List and Add any entries to exclude from the External Dynamic List. You can add up to 100 entries to exclude.
STEP 10 | Save your configuration.
STEP 11 | Select Commit and Commit and Push the configuration changes.

Create a URL Category Object
Create a custom URL category object to add it to a URL Filtering profile. Custom URL category objects allow you to specify exceptions to URL category enforcement in a policy rule, and allows you to create a custom URL category based on multiple URL categories:  Define exceptions to URL category enforcement--Create a custom list of URLs that you want to use to
match criteria in a security policy rule. This is a good way to specify exceptions to URL categories where you would like to enforce specific URLs differently than the URL category to which they belong.  Define a custom URL category based on multiple PAN-DB categories--Allows you to target enforcement for websites that match a set of categories. The website or page must match all the categories defined as part of the custom category.
STEP 1 | Launch Prisma Access Cloud Management.
STEP 2 | Select Objects > URL Category and Add a URL category object.
STEP 3 | Enter a Name for the custom URL category.
STEP 4 | (Optional) Enter a description for the custom URL category.
STEP 5 | Select the category Type from the drop-down.  URL List--Add URLs that you want to enforce differently than the URL category to which they belong. Use this list type to define exceptions for URL Category enforcement, or to define a list of URLs as beloning to a custom category.  Category Match--Provide targeted enforcement for websites that match a set of categories. The website must match all the categories as defined as part of the custom category.
STEP 6 | Add the website or URL category based on category type selected in the previous step.
STEP 7 | Save your configuration.
STEP 8 | Select Commit and Commit and Push your configuration changes.

and includes support for scanning inside compressed files and data encoding schemes. You can only add the default and best-practice antivirus security profiles to security rules or security profile groups. Creating custom antivirus security profiles is not supported. The actions the security processing node takes when responding to an antivirus threat are:  Default--For each threat signature and Antivirus signature that is defined by Palo Alto Networks, a
default action is specified internally. Typically, the default action is an alert or a reset-both. The default action is displayed in parenthesis, for example default (alert) in the threat or Antivirus signature  Allow--Permits the application traffic.  Alert--Generates an alert for each application traffic flow. The alert is saved in the threat log.  Drop--Drops the application traffic.  Reset Client--For TCP, resets the client-side connection. For UDP, drops the connection.  Reset Server--For TCP, resets the server-side connection. For UDP, drops the connection.  Reset Both--For TCP, resets the connection on both client and server ends. For UDP, drops the connection.  Block IP--Blocks traffic from either a source or a source-destination pair. It is configurable for a specified period of time. STEP 1 | Launch Prisma Access Cloud Management. STEP 2 | Select Objects > Security Profiles > Antivirus. STEP 3 | Review the default antivirus security profile. The default antivirus security profile inspects all of the listed protocol decoders for viruses, and generates alerts for SMPT, IMAP, and POP3 protocols while blocking FTP, HTTP, and SMB protocols. STEP 4 | Review the best-practice antivirus security profile.
View the Default Anti-Spyware Security Profiles
Anti-Spyware profiles allow you to block malicious traffic from compromised hosts by enabling you to stop compromised hosts from trying to phone-home or beacon out to external command-and-control servers. You can apply various levels of protection between zones. You can only add the default, strict, bestpractice-strict, and best-practice anti-spyware security profiles to security rules or security profile groups. Creating custom anti-spyware security profiles is not supported. The actions the security processing node takes when responding to a anti-spyware event are:

Create a Policy Rule
Prisma Access allows you to create various types of policies to protect your network from threats and disruptions, as well as help you optimize network resource allocation. Rules are evaluated from top to bottom and when traffic matches against the defined rule criteria, subsequent rules are not evaluated. You should order more specific policy rules above the more generic ones to enforce the best match criteria possible. A log is generated for traffic that matches a policy rule when logging is enabled for the rule. Logging options are configurable for each rule.
For corporate access security and decryption, best practice policy rules are available and allow you to quickly protect your corporate network using a Palo Alto Networks best practice security posture. These rules cannot be edited to ensure that you always have a minimum level of security readily available.
 Create a Security Policy Rule  Create a QoS Policy Rule  Create a Decryption Policy Rule  Create an Application Override Policy Rule
Create a Security Policy Rule
Security policy rules determine whether to block or allow a session based on traffic attributes defined in the policy rule. All traffic that passes through the Prisma security processing node is matched against a session and the matching security policy rule is applied to the traffic in that session. You can create the following security policies:
 Corporate Access--Allow or deny traffic within your trusted corporate network. Corporate Access security rules allow you to define which users can access corporate assets within the defined trust zone.
 Internet Access--Allow or deny traffic from your trust zone to the internet. Internet Access security rules allow you to define whether trusted users and devices can access resources outside of your trusted corporate network. This may include sanctioned applications, social media, or unsanctioned or unknown applications and websites.
To protect your trusted corporate devices:
 Security Policy Actions  Create an Internet Access Security Rule  Customize the Predefined Internet Access Security Rules  Create a Corporate Access Security Rule
Security Policy Actions
For traffic that matches the attributes defined in a security policy, you can apply the following actions:

Action Allow (default) Deny
Drop

Description
Allows the traffic.
Blocks traffic and enforces the default Deny Action defined for the application that is being denied. To view the deny action defined by default for an application, view the application details in Objects > Applications or check the application details in Applipedia.
Silently drops the traffic; for an application, it overrides the default deny action. A TCP reset is not sent to the host/application.

152 PRISMA ACCESS ADMINISTRATOR'S GUIDE (CLOUD MANAGED) | Create Prisma Access Policy
 2019 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

Action
Reset client Reset server Reset both

Description For Layer 3 interfaces, to optionally send an ICMP unreachable response to the client, set Action: Drop and enable the Send ICMP Unreachable check box. When enabled, the Security Processing Node sends the ICMP code for communication with the destination is administratively prohibited--ICMPv4: Type 3, Code 13; ICMPv6: Type 1, Code 1.
Sends a TCP reset to the client-side device.
Sends a TCP reset to the server-side device.
Sends a TCP reset to both the client-side and server-side devices.

A reset is sent only after a session is formed. If the session is blocked before a 3-way handshake is completed, the Security Processing Node will not send the reset.
For a TCP session with a reset action, the Security Processing Node does not send an ICMP Unreachable response.
For a UDP session with a drop or reset action, if the ICMP Unreachable check box is selected, the Security Processing Node sends an ICMP message to the client.

Create an Internet Access Security Rule
Internet access security rules allow you to allow or deny traffic from your corporate network to IP addresses or applications on the internet and allows you to specify individual IP addresses or users in the source and destination. These can be things such as sanctioned SaaS applications, social media websites, or malicious or unknown websites. When on-boarding mobile users, Prisma Access creates a default internet access policy.
For example, if you use Google Drive to store business-critical documents, you can create an internet access security rule to allow traffic to Google Drive. At the same time, your marketing team uses social media to promote your products, but you do not want all users to have access to those same social media websites. You can create an internet access security rule to allow traffic for sanctioned social media users, while blocking access to social media sites for all other users.
STEP 1 | Launch Prisma Access Cloud Management.
STEP 2 | Select Policies > Security > Internet Access and Add a new security rule.
STEP 3 | Enter a Name for the security rule.
STEP 4 | (Optional) Enter a Description of the policy rule.
STEP 5 | (Optional) Select one or more Tags to group the policy rule.
STEP 6 | Define the matching criteria for the traffic source. 1. In the Source tab, select a Zone. You can select Trust, Clientless VPN, or both. 2. Specify the Source IP address(es) within the selected source zone(s) to which the rule applies. Select any to apply the rule to all IP addresses in your trusted corporate network, or Add specific IP addresses to which the rule applies. You must Create an Address Object before you can add it as a source in a policy rule.

STEP 7 | Define the matching criteria for the traffic destination. 1. In the Destination tab, verify that the Zone selected is the Untrust zone. 2. Specify the Destination IP address(es) within the selected destination zone to which the rule applies. Select any to apply the rule to all IP addresses on your corporate network, or Add specific IP addresses to which the rule applies. You must Create an Address Object before you can add it as a destination in a policy rule.
Selecting the panw-bulletproof-ip-list as a Destination IP address is not supported and results in a Push operation failure.
STEP 8 | In the Application tab, Select and Add one or more applications you want to block or allow. You can select multiple individual applications, or you can use application groups or application filters.

Customize the Predefined Internet Access Security Rules
Prisma Access provides predefined internet access security policy rules based on best practices. These rules block known malicious traffic, log high risk traffic, and allow general web browsing. While these predefined rules are good for verifying that Prisma Access is provisioned and working as expected, you should customize these rules to add more granularity for your environment. For example, you might want to customize the allow-general-web-browsing rule to allow specific sanctioned applications or types of applications, or block additional URL categories (beyond those that are already blocked in the best practice URL Filtering profile). In addition, you must modify the rules to enable Prisma Access to forward the corresponding logs to the Cortex Data Lake. Each predefined internet access security policy rule that allows traffic has a predefined best practice security profile group attached (either best-practice or best-practice-strict) that scans traffic that matches the rule for known and unknown threats using the best practice security profiles (Antivirus, Anti-Spyware, Vulnerability Protection, URL Filtering, File Blocking, and WildFire Analysis). If you want to modify a security profile, you must clone to modify it. You must then also clone the best practice security profile group and then attach the new profile to the profile group. STEP 1 | Modify policy objects as needed for your environment.
For example, if you wanted to add gambling to the list of URL categories that are already blocked by the best practice URL Filtering profile, you would clone the best-practice URL filtering profile and set the Site Access to Block. 1. Select Objects > Security Profiles > URL Filtering, select the best-practice profile and Clone it.
2. Select the cloned profile (named best-practice-1 by default) and advance to the page with the gambling category and set Site Access and, optionally, User Credential Submission, to Block and then Save the new profile.

STEP 6 | Save the rule and Commit and Push your changes.
Create a Corporate Access Security Rule
Corporate access security rules allow you to block or allow traffic within your corporate network, and allows you to specify individual IP addresses or users in the source and destination. For example, if you have critical IT management systems in your trust zone that you want only sanctioned IT administrators to access, you can create a corporate access security rule to allow access to those sanctioned IT administrators while restricting access to any other user within the network. STEP 1 | Launch Prisma Access Cloud Management. STEP 2 | Select Policies > Security > Corporate Access and Add a new security rule. STEP 3 | Enter a Name for the security rule. STEP 4 | (Optional) Enter a Description of the policy rule. STEP 5 | (Optional) Select one or more Tags to group the policy rule. STEP 6 | Define the matching criteria for the traffic source.

Specify the Destination IP address(es) within the selected destination zone to which the rule applies. Select any to apply the rule to all IP addresses on your corporate network, or Add specific IP addresses to which the rule applies. You must Create an Address Object before you can add it as a destination in a policy rule.
Selecting the panw-bulletproof-ip-list as a Destination IP address is not supported and results in a Push operation failure.
STEP 8 | In the Application tab, Add one or more applications you want to block or allow. You can select multiple individual applications, or you can use application groups or application filters. You must Create Application Objects before you can add it as an application in a policy rule. By default, any is selected and applies the rule to all application traffic.
STEP 9 | Define the traffic match criteria based on the service used. 1. In the Services/URL Category tab, Select and Add the Services to match the policy rule to. By default, the policy rule is set to decrypt any traffic on TCP or UDP ports. You can Add a service or service group, and optionally set the rule to application-default to match to applications only on the application default ports.

Create a QoS Policy Rule
Quality of Service (QoS) policy rules to identify traffic that requires preferential treatment or bandwidth limiting. QoS rules allow you to enact policies on a network that ensure its ability to dependably run highpriority applications and traffic under limited network capacity. You can configure traffic QoS treatment using the following codepoints:  Expedited Forwarding (EF)--Used to request low loss, low latency and guaranteed bandwidth for traffic.
Packets with EF codepoint values are typically guaranteed highest priority delivery.  Assured Forwarding (AF)--Used to provide reliable delivery for applications. PAckets with AF codepoints
indicate a request for traffic to receive higher priority treatment than best effort service provides. Packets with EF codepoint take precedence over packets with AF codepoint.  Class Selector (CS)--Used to provide backwards compatibility with network IP addresses that use the IP precedence field to mark priority traffic.  IP Precedence (ToS)--Used by legacy network IP addresses to mark priority traffic.  Custom Codepoint--Create a custom codepoint to match traffic by entering a Codepoint Name and Binary Value. For example, you can create a QoS policy rule to prioritize voice communications, such as voice over IP (VOIP), to ensure consistent packet transmission. This ensures that voice communication are consistent.
STEP 1 | Launch Prisma Access Cloud Management.
STEP 2 | Select Policies > QoS and Add a new QoS rule.
STEP 3 | Enter a Name for the QoS rule.
STEP 4 | (Optional) Enter a Description of the policy rule.
STEP 5 | (Optional) Select one or more Tags to group the policy rule.
STEP 6 | Define the QoS treatment the traffic receives based on DSCP value. 1. Select DSCP/TOS and select Codepoints.
By default, Any is selected to allow the policy to match to traffic regardless of the Differentiated SErvices Code Point (DSCP) value or the IP Precedence/Type of Service (ToS) defined for the traffic. If this satisifies your QoS requirements, continue to Step 7. 2. Add a new codepoint and Select the Type of DSCP/ToS codepoint marking for rule to match to traffic. 3. Specify the Codepoint value to match the QoS policy to traffic on a more granular level. For example, with Assured Forwarding (AF) selected, further specify the codepoint value such as AF11.
When Expedited Forwarding (EF) is selected, a granular Codepoint value cannot be specified. The QoS policy rule matches to traffic marked with any EF codepoint value.

STEP 8 | Save your configuration.
STEP 9 | Select Commit and Commit and Push your configuration changes.
Create a Decryption Policy Rule
Decryption policy rules allow you to define traffic to decrypt and the type of decryption you want to perform on the indicated traffic. Decryption policy rules are created when onboarding mobile users. These are best practice policies for decrypting non-financial, non-personal, and non-healthcare related traffic. You can perform the following types of decryption:
 SSL Forward Proxy--Use to decrypt and inspect SSL/TLS traffic from internal users to the web. This type of decryption prevents malware concealed as SSL encrypted traffic by decrypting traffic so that the security processing nodes can apply security policies to the traffic.
 SSH Proxy--Use to decrypt inbound and outbound SSH connections, and ensures attackers do not use SSH to tunnel unwanted applications and content.
 Certificate--Use a certificate you upload to decrypt inbound and outbound traffic.
For example, an attacker compromises a website that uses SSL encryption. Users visit that website and unknowingly download and exploit malware, that then uses the infected endpoint to move laterally through the network to compromise other system. Create an decryption policy using SSL Forward Proxy to decrypt and inspect the SSL traffic.
STEP 1 | Launch Prisma Access Cloud Management.
STEP 2 | Select Policies > Security > Decryption and Add a new decryption rule or Clone the default best practice rules.
STEP 3 | Enter a Name for the decryption rule.
STEP 4 | (Optional) Enter a Description of the policy rule.
STEP 5 | (Optional) Select one or more Tags to group the policy rule.
STEP 6 | Define the matching criteria for the traffic source. 1. In the Source tab, select a Zone. You can select Trust, Clientless VPN, or both. 2. Specify the Source IP address(es) within the selected source zone(s) to which the rule applies. Select any to apply the rule to all IP addresses in your trusted corporate network, or Add specific IP addresses to which the rule applies. You must Create an Address Object before you can add it as a source in a policy rule. 3. Specify the Users within the selected source zone(s) and source IP addresses to which the rule applies. Select any to apply this to all configured admin roles, or Add specific admin roles.
STEP 7 | Define the matching criteria for the traffic destination. 1. In the Destination tab, select the Zone the traffic is intended for. You can select Trust, Untrust, or both. 2. Specify the Destination IP address(es) within the selected destination zone to which the rule applies. Select any to apply the rule to all IP addresses on your corporate network, or Add specific IP addresses to which the rule applies. You must Create an Address Object before you can add it as a destination in a policy rule.

STEP 11 | Select Commit and Commit and Push your configuration changes.
Create an Application Override Policy Rule
Create an application override policy to designate applications be processed using fast path Layer-4 inspection instead of using the App-ID for Layer-7 inspection. This forces the security enforcement node to handle the session as a regular stateful inspection and saves application processing times.
You can create an application override policy rule when you do not want traffic inspection for custom applications between known IP addresses. For example, if you have a custom application on a non-standard port that you know users accessing the application are sanctioned, and both are in the Trust zone, you can override the application inspection requirements. for the trusted users accessing the custom application.
STEP 1 | Launch Prisma Access Cloud Management.
STEP 2 | Select Policies > Security > Application Override and Add a new application override rule.

Release Cadence for Prisma Access Infrastructure Updates
The following table describes how Prisma Access updates its infrastructure components, including content and software updates. This table also indicates whether Prisma Access automatically updates the software. If any updates are not automatic, you can learn how to apply those infrastructure updates.
You can also check the status of all cloud services from the Hub.

Component GlobalProtect app

Update Schedule
 Major GlobalProtect App Releases (for example, x.0 or 4.x)--Prisma Access updates the app with the latest major release 7-10 days after the general availability of the x.0.1 version of that release.
For example, given an app release of 4.0, Prisma Access updates the app 7-10 days after the 4.0.1 release.  Minor GlobalProtect App Releases (for example, 4.1.x)--Prisma Access updates the app with the latest minor release 7-10 days after the general availability of that release.

Comments
The cloud controls the version of the app that is available for upgrade.
