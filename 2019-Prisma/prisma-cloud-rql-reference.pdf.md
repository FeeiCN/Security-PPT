Prisma Cloud Resource Query Language (RQL)
Prisma Cloud Resource Query Language (RQL) is a powerful and flexible tool that helps you gain security and operational insights about your deployments in public cloud environments. You can use RQL to perform configuration checks on resources deployed on different cloud platforms and to gain visibility and insights into user and network events. You can use these security insights to create policy guardrails that secure your cloud environments. RQL is a structured query language that resembles Structured Query Language (SQL). RQL supports the following types of queries:  Config--Use Config Query to search for the configuration of the cloud resources.  Event--Use Event Query to search and audit all the console and API access events in your cloud
environment.  Network--Use Network Query to search real-time network events in your environment. Use RQL to find answers to fundamental questions that help you understand what is happening on your network. For example, you can find answers to the following questions:  Do I have S3 buckets with encryption disabled?  Do I have databases that are directly accessible from the internet?  Who uses a root account to manage day-to-day administrative activities on my network?  Which cloud resources are missing critical patches that make them exploitable?

Config Query
Prisma Cloud ingests various services and associated configuration data from AWS, Azure, and GCP cloud environments. Use Config Query to retrieve resource information and identify misconfigurations, compliance violations, and cloud identity, access, and password management policies. To investigate configuration issues, use the config where query in the search box on the Investigate tab of the Prisma Cloud admin console.  Config Query Attributes  Config Query Examples
Config Query Attributes
Review your options when using config where on the Investigate tab of the Prisma Cloud administrative console.
Each attribute allows you to narrow your search criteria. The auto-suggest feature displays expressions and Operators available for each attribute.  api.name
Cloud APIs are part of cloud platforms and they enable the development of applications and services used for provisioning resources, virtual machines, platforms, and software. Cloud APIs are generally based on a REST framework. For each cloud platform, depending on the resource, there are several APIs available. You can use the api.name attribute to identify a specific configuration for the resource. For a list of all API names available for each cloud platform, see AWS APIs Ingested by Prisma Cloud, Microsoft Azure APIs Ingested by Prisma Cloud, and GCP APIs Ingested by Prisma Cloud. The api.name attribute is required in configuration queries except when you are querying the configuration for host findings. When used with the cloud.type attribute, auto-complete displays only the API names that pertain to the cloud type you selected.

 2019 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

For example, you can list SQL instances on Google Cloud: config where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-sql-instances-list'  addcolumn Use the addcolumn attribute to add columns to the results displayed on screen. This enables you to view the JSON data for the resources that correspond to your query.
For example, you can add columns for key name and image ID for EC2 instances: config where api.name = 'aws-ec2-describe-instances' addcolumn keyName
hypervisor imageId  cloud.type
Use the cloud.type attribute to narrow down your search option to specific clouds. Supported options are AWS, Azure, and GCP. For example, you can list all EC2 instances in your AWS cloud accounts: config where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-ec2-describe-instances'  cloud.service
PRISMATM CLOUD RESOURCE QUERY LANGUAGE (RQL) REFERENCE | Prisma Cloud RQL Reference 9
 2019 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

Use the cloud.service attribute to query configuration for a specific cloud service, such as IAM, S3, or Virtual Machines. For example, you can list all S3 storage bucket access control lists (ACLs) in your AWS cloud accounts:
config where cloud.type = 'aws' AND cloud.service = 'S3' AND api.name = 'aws-s3api-get-bucketacl'
 cloud.account Use the cloud.account attribute to narrow down a configuration search to one or more cloud accounts that you connected to the Prisma Cloud. For example, you can list EC2 instances in your Production AWS account:
config where cloud.type = 'aws' AND cloud.account = 'Production' AND api.name = 'aws-ec2-describe-instances'
 cloud.region Use the cloud.region attribute to narrow down a configuration search to one or more cloud regions. For example, you can list all virtual machine instances in your Azure account in the Central US region:
config where cloud.type = 'azure' and cloud.account = 'RedLock - Azure Subscription' AND cloud.region = 'Azure Central US' AND api.name = 'azure-
vm-list'  cloud.account.group
Use the cloud.account.group attribute to narrow down the configuration to the cloud account in your cloud account group. For example, you can list all the Amazon RDS instances in all your AWS accounts:
config where cloud.account.group = 'All my AWS accounts' AND cloud.region = 'AWS Virginia' AND api.name = 'aws-rds-describe-db-instances'
 hostfinding.type, hostfinding.severity, hostfinding.source Use host finding attributes to query for vulnerabilities on workloads--destination or source resources --that have one or more host-related security findings. Prisma Cloud ingests host vulnerability data from external sources, such as Qualys, Tenable.io, and AWS Inspector and ingests host and IAM users security-related alerts from AWS GuardDuty. To leverage hostfinding attributes, first enable the integration with the host vulnerability providers.
10 PRISMATM CLOUD RESOURCE QUERY LANGUAGE (RQL) REFERENCE | Prisma Cloud RQL Reference
 2019 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

For example, you can list all the hosts with a critical host vulnerability:
config where hostfinding.type = 'Host Vulnerability' AND hostfinding.severity = 'critical'
Or find potential security issues by source:
config where hostfinding.source = 'AWS Guard Duty' AND hostfinding.type = 'AWS GuardDuty IAM ' AND api.name= 'aws-iam-list-users'
Host finding attributes support the following resource types:  Prisma Cloud--Fetches all resources that have one or more open alerts generated by Prisma Cloud.  Host Vulnerability--Fetches all resources that have one or more of the host vulnerabilities (such as
CVE-2016-8655) reported by external providers such as AWS Inspector, Qualys, or Tenable.io.  Compliance--Fetches all resources that are in violation of one or more compliance issues reported by
external compliance host-scanning systems.  AWS Inspector Runtime Behavior Analysis--Fetches all resources which are in violation of one or
more rules reported by the AWS Runtime Behavior Analysis package.  AWS Inspector Security Best Practices--Fetches all resources which are in violation of one or more
rules reported by the AWS Inspector Security best practices package.  AWS GuardDuty--Fetches all resources which have one or more findings reported by AWS
GuardDuty.  hostfinding.name
Use the hostfinding.name attribute and enter a string value to find a host vulnerability by the name defined on your host vulnerability provider. Specify the hostfinding.type for the autocomplete suggestion to specify a hostfinding name.
PRISMATM CLOUD RESOURCE QUERY LANGUAGE (RQL) REFERENCE | Prisma Cloud RQL Reference 11
 2019 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

For example, you can list all the hosts with the CVE-2016-8399 vulnerability:
config where hostfinding.type = 'Host Vulnerability' AND hostfinding.name = 'CVE-2016-8399'
or,
config where hostfinding.type = 'AWS GuardDuty IAM' AND hostfinding.name= `Recon:IAM/TorIPCaller'
 json.rule Prisma Cloud ingests data and updates events in the JSON format. Use the json.rule attribute to query or filter specific elements included in the JSON configuration related to a cloud resource. The json.rule attribute enables you to look for specific configurations: parse JSON-encoded values, extract data from JSON, or search for value within any configuration policy for cloud accounts that you are monitoring using Prisma Cloud. This json.rule attribute allows you to create boolean combinations and find data in selected fields within the JSON data that represents the resource. When you include the json.rule attribute in a configuration query, the auto-complete displays the elements or resources that match your search criteria. Because JSON has a nested structure, you can search for elements at the root level, inside the JSON tree, or in an array object. For example, you can list all Azure Linux Virtual Machines where password authentication is disabled:
config where api.name = 'azure-vm-list' AND json.rule = ['properties.osProfile'].linuxConfiguration.disablePasswordAuthentication is true
Config Query Examples

Event Query
Event queries help you to detect and investigate console and API access events, monitor privileged activities, detect account compromise, and detect unusual user behavior in your cloud environments. To investigate events, compose event where queries in the search box on the Investigate tab of the Prisma Cloud administrative console.  Event Query Attributes  Event Query Examples
Event Query Attributes
Review your options when using event where on the Investigate tab of the Prisma Cloud administrative console:
Each attribute allows you to narrow your search criteria. As you use these attributes, the auto-suggestion feature shows the available expressions and the Operators that are applicable for each attribute.  alert.id
Use the alert.id attribute to view alert details on the Investigate tab. For example, you can visualize the alert details for a set of alerts such as P-8444, P-8421, P-8420. event where alert.id IN (`P-8444', `P-8421', `P-8420')  cloud.account Use the cloud.account attribute to narrow down audit search to one or more cloud accounts that you connected to Prisma Cloud.
16 PRISMATM CLOUD RESOURCE QUERY LANGUAGE (RQL) REFERENCE | Prisma Cloud RQL Reference
 2019 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

For example, you can list entities or users who deleted security groups from a given cloud account: event where cloud.account = 'Developer Sandbox' AND operation IN
( 'DeleteSecurityGroup' )  cloud.account.group
Use the cloud.account.group attribute to narrow your search to only the cloud accounts in your cloud account group. For example, you can list entities or users who deleted Virtual Private Clouds in all your AWS accounts: event where operation = 'DeleteVpc' AND cloud.account.group = 'All my AWS
accounts'
event where cloud.account.group = 'All my AWS accounts' AND cloud.service = 'autoscaling.amazonaws.com' AND user = 'maxusertest__gahp1Tho'
 cloud.type Use the cloud.type attribute to narrow your search to a specific cloud platform. Supported options are AWS, Azure, and GCP. For example, you can list all users who deleted S3 buckets: event where cloud.type = 'aws' AND cloud.service = 's3.amazonaws.com' AND operation = 'DeleteBucket'
 cloud.region Use the cloud.region attribute to narrow down audit search to one or more cloud regions. For example, you can list entities or users who deleted access keys from a given cloud account: event where cloud.account = 'Developer Sandbox' AND cloud.region = 'AWS Canada' AND operation IN ( 'DeleteAccessKey' )
 cloud.service Use the cloud.service attribute to search for information using a specific service name in your cloud accounts.
PRISMATM CLOUD RESOURCE QUERY LANGUAGE (RQL) REFERENCE | Prisma Cloud RQL Reference 17
 2019 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

For example, you can review details for users who performed operations, such as deleting cloud trail logs or disabling or stopping logging events:
event where system = 'cloudtrail.amazonaws.com' AND operation IN ( 'DeleteTrail' , 'DisableLogging' , 'StopLogging' )
 crud Use the crud attribute to search for information for users or entities who performed Create, Read, Update, or Delete operations. You can list all Azure resources that were deleted:
event where cloud.account in ( 'Azure - Microsoft Azure Sponsorship' ) and crud = 'delete'
 operation An operation is an action performed by users on resources in a cloud account. Use the operation attribute to start typing the name of the operation in which you are interested and Prisma Cloud autocompletes a list of operations that match your search criteria. For example, you can list details of delete operations on VPCs, VPC endpoints, and VPC peering connections:
event where operation in ( 'DeleteVpc' , 'DeleteVpcEndpoints' 'DeleteVpcPeeringConnection' )
 Subject Use this attribute to search for actions that a specific user or an instance performed on your cloud account. For example, you can list console login operations by Ben:
event where operation = 'ConsoleLogin' AND subject = 'ben'  role
Use this attribute to filter the search results by role. For example, you can look for events performed by the Okta role:
Event where role = 'OktaDevReadWriteRole'  json.rule
Use this attribute to filter specific elements included in the JSON configuration related to a cloud resource. The json.rule attribute enables you to look for specific configurations--parse JSONencoded values, extract data from JSON, search for value within any configuration policy for cloud accounts that you are monitoring using Prisma Cloud.
18 PRISMATM CLOUD RESOURCE QUERY LANGUAGE (RQL) REFERENCE | Prisma Cloud RQL Reference

Network Query
When you onboard your cloud accounts to Prisma Cloud, it monitors network traffic from and to your assets deployed on the cloud environment, and you can then use this data to find previously unidentified network security risks. With Network queries, network where, you can for example, detect when services, applications or databases are exposed to the Internet and fix risky configuration issues, or search for assets that are receiving traffic and connections from suspicious IP addresses to prevent data exfiltration attempts before it is too late. Network queries are currently supported on AWS and Azure cloud environments. GCP is in beta.  Network Query Attributes  Network Query Examples
Network Query Attributes
Review your options when using Network where on the Investigate tab of the RedLock administrative console:
22 PRISMATM CLOUD RESOURCE QUERY LANGUAGE (RQL) REFERENCE | Prisma Cloud RQL Reference
 2019 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

Each attribute allows you to narrow your search criteria. As you use these attributes, the auto-suggestion capability shows the available expressions, and Operators that are applicable for each attribute.  cloud.account
Use the cloud.account attribute to search for network activity in one or more cloud accounts that you connected to the RedLock service. For example, you can view network activity in a cloud account with > 1MB traffic:
network where cloud.account = 'Developer Sandbox' AND bytes > 1048576  cloud.region
Use the cloud.region attribute to search for network activity in your cloud regions. For example, you can view network activity in Developer sandbox account for AWS Oregon region:
network where cloud.account = 'Developer Sandbox' AND cloud.region = 'AWS Oregon' AND bytes > 0
PRISMATM CLOUD RESOURCE QUERY LANGUAGE (RQL) REFERENCE | Prisma Cloud RQL Reference 23
 2019 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

 cloud.account.group Use the cloud.account.group attribute to search for network activity within a group of cloud accounts that you have connected to the RedLock service. For example, you can view network activity across your AWS accounts that belong to the Oregon region where more than 100000 packets were transmitted:
network where cloud.account.group = 'All my AWS accounts' AND cloud.region = 'AWS Oregon' AND packets > 100000
 dest.ip, source.ip Use the dest.ip, source.ip attribute to filter your network to view traffic from an originating or a receiving IP address.
The value 0.0.0.0 does not mean any IP address, it means any public IP address.
For example, you can view network traffic to a public IP address to which more than 1000000 bytes were transmitted:
network where dest.ip = 0.0.0.0 AND bytes > 1000000
For example, you can view SSH traffic from any public IP address on the internet:
network where source.ip = 0.0.0.0 and dest.port = 22
 dest.port Use the dest.port attribute to filter your network activity to view traffic from a destination port. For example, you can view network traffic for any public IP address where the destination port is 27017:
network where dest.port = 27017 AND source.ip = 0.0.0.0
 dest.outboundpeers, source.outboundpeers Use the dest.outboundpeers and source.outboundpeers attributes for a count of distinct IP addresses to which this asset establishes a connection. These network attributes enable you to aggregate connection counts for both ingress and egress traffic to help detect account compromise or identify hosts that are establishing multiple SSH connections from one or more external IP addresses.
 dest.outboundports, source.outboundports Use the dest.outboundports and source.outboundports attributes for a count of distinct destination ports to which this asset establishes a connection. These network attributes enable you to aggregate connection counts for both ingress and egress traffic. For example, you can detect an attempt to perform a port scan or port sweep, or detect an attempt to set up a number of egress connections on the crypto ports.
 dest.publicnetwork, source.publicnetwork Use the Source.publicnetwork and dest.publicnetwork attributes to query traffic from and to pre-defined networks. For example, Internet IPs represent all public IPs, Suspicious IPs represent all suspicious IPs.
You can also define your own network with a set of IP addresses/CIDRs to see traffic from/to your internal networks. If you belong to the System Admin permission group, you can set it up in Settings > IP Whitelisting.
24 PRISMATM CLOUD RESOURCE QUERY LANGUAGE (RQL) REFERENCE | Prisma Cloud RQL Reference
 2019 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

For example, you can view traffic on the destination port 3389 and that are classified as internet IPs or suspicious IPs: network where dest.port IN (3389) and dest.publicnetwork IN ('Internet
IPs' , 'Suspicious IPs' ) and bytes > 0  dest.resource, source.resource
Use the dest.resource, source.resource attributes to search and filter the network by a destination or a source resource for host findings, roles, security groups, tags, and virtual networks. dest.resource IN or source.resource IN; displays more options:
 hostfinding.severity, hostfinding.type, hostfinding.source Use hostfinding attributes to query for vulnerabilities on destination or source resources that have one or more host related security findings. RedLock ingests host vulnerability data from external sources such as Qualys, Tenable.io, AWS Inspector, and host security related alerts from AWS GuardDuty. To leverage hostfinding attributes, first enable the integration with the host vulnerability providers. For example, you can list hostfinding events from AWS Guard duty on destination resource which have severity as critical: network where dest.resource IN ( resource where hostfinding.type = 'AWS GuardDuty Host' AND hostfinding.severity = 'critical' ) AND bytes > 0 For example, you can list host vulnerability events on the destination resource: network where dest.resource IN ( resource where hostfinding.type IN ('Host Vulnerability' ) ) and bytes > 0
 securitygroup.name Use the securitygroup.name attribute to filter the network traffic by security group name. For example, you can view the network traffic which is hitting the security groups with names AWSOpsWorks-Java-App-Server and AWS-OpsWorks-Blank-Server:
PRISMATM CLOUD RESOURCE QUERY LANGUAGE (RQL) REFERENCE | Prisma Cloud RQL Reference 25
 2019 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

network where source.ip = 0.0.0.0 and dest.resource IN ( resource where securitygroup.name IN ( 'AWS-OpsWorks-Java-App-Server' , 'AWS-OpsWorks-
Blank-Server' ))  virtualnetwork.name
Use the virtualnetwork.name attribute to filter the network traffic by virtual network names. For example, you can view the network traffic which is hitting the virtual network ICHS_FLORENCE:
network where dest.resource IN ( resource where virtualnetwork.name IN ( 'ICHS_FLORENCE' ))
 dest.state, source.state Use dest.state or source.state attributes to view traffic originating from or destined to a specific state within a country. For example, you can view network traffic to Karnataka in India:
network where cloud.account = 'Developer Sandbox' AND dest.country = 'India' AND dest.state = 'Karnataka'
For example, you can view network traffic from Karnataka in India:
network where cloud.account = 'Developer Sandbox' AND source.country = 'India' AND source.state = 'Karnataka'
 dest.country, source.country Use the dest.country, source.country attributes to filter your network to view traffic from the country of its origin or the country where the traffic is received. For example, you can view network activity where the destination of the traffic is in China and Russia:
network where dest.country IN ( 'China' , 'Russia' ) and bytes > 0
To view network activity where the source of the traffic is in China:
network where source.country = 'China' AND bytes > 0  bytes
Use the bytes attribute to search for network related information by the aggregate byte volume while the transmission lasts. For example, you can search for network traffic by internet IPs, suspicious IPs and bytes:
network where source.publicnetwork IN ( 'Internet IPs' , 'Suspicious IPs' ) and bytes > 0
 response.bytes Use the dest.country, source.country attribute to search for network related information by the aggregate response byte volume. For example, you can search for network traffic with response bytes more than 1,00,000:
26 PRISMATM CLOUD RESOURCE QUERY LANGUAGE (RQL) REFERENCE | Prisma Cloud RQL Reference
 2019 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

network where response.bytes > 100000 AND cloud.account = 'Sandbox Account'  accepted.bytes
Use the accepted.bytes attribute to search for the network related information by the aggregate accepted byte volume. For example, you can search for network traffic with accepted bytes more than 1,00,000:
network where accepted.bytes > 100000 AND cloud.account = 'Sandbox Account'  packets
Use the packets attribute to search for network related information by the aggregate packet volume while the transmission lasts. For example, you can identify traffic from internal workloads to internet IPs on ports 8545,30303 that are known to mine Ethereum:
network where dest.port IN (8545,30303) and dest.publicnetwork IN ('Internet IPs' , 'Suspicious IPs' ) and packets> 0
 protocol Use the protocol attribute to search for network-related information in relation to network protocols. For example, you can search for network information by TCP protocol and where the destination port is 21:
network where src.ip=0.0.0.0 AND protocol='TCP' AND dest.port IN (21)  role
Use the role attribute to filter the network traffic by roles. For example, you can view all network traffic in RedLock account where the destination resource role is not AWS NAT Gateway and AWS ELB:
network where cloud.account = 'RedLock' AND source.ip = 0.0.0.0 AND dest.resource IN ( resource where role NOT IN ( 'AWS NAT Gateway' , 'AWS ELB' ))
For example, you can view traffic originating from suspicious IPs and internet IPS which are hitting the resource roles AWS RDS and Database:
network where source.publicnetwork IN ( 'Suspicious IPs' , 'Internet IPs' ) and dest.resource IN ( resource where role IN ( 'AWS RDS' , 'Database' ))
 tag Use tag attribute to filter the network traffic by tags. For example, you can view network traffic which is hitting the resources that are tagged as NISP:
network where dest.resource IN ( resource where tag ('name') = 'NISP')  traffic.type IN
PRISMATM CLOUD RESOURCE QUERY LANGUAGE (RQL) REFERENCE | Prisma Cloud RQL Reference 27

Use traffic.type IN attribute to view how entities within your cloud environment have accepted and rejected traffic.
For example,

NETWORK WHERE src.publicnetwork IN ('Suspicious IPs','Internet IPs') AND dest.resource IN (resource WHERE virtualnetwork.name IN ( 'vpc-323cda49' )) AND dest.ip IN (172.31.12.172 ) AND traffic.type IN ('REJECTED')

Network Query Examples
Use this section for some examples that show you how to use Network Query Attributes in RQL for investigating Network issues:

DESCRIPTION
View traffic originating from the Internet & suspicious IPs to resource with Database role.

RQL
network where source.publicnetwork IN ( 'Suspicious IPs' , 'Internet IPs' ) and dest.resource IN ( resource where role IN ( 'AWS RDS' , 'Database' ) )

Find instances that are accessible over the internet using insecure ports.

network where source.publicnetwork IN ( 'Internet IPs' ) and protocol = 'TCP' AND dest.port IN ( 21,23,80)

Find hosts with Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities receiving network traffic.

network where dest.resource IN ( resource where hostfinding.type IN ( 'Host Vulnerability' ) AND hostfinding.name IN ( 'CVE-2017-5754', 'CVE-2017-5753', 'CVE-2017-5715' ) ) and bytes > 0

Look for traffic from internet to any instance outside of Web servers, NAT Gateways or ELBs.

Network where src.publicnetwork IN ('Suspicious IPs','Internet IPs') AND dest.resource IN ( resource where role not in ( 'AWS NAT Gateway' , 'AWS ELB' ) ) and protocol not in ( 'ICMP' , 'ICMP6' )

Look for source entities which are AWS ELBs with connections to more than 10 unique peer IP addresses, but those peer IPs are not endpoints that function as Databases.

Network where src.resource IN (RESOURCE WHERE role = ('AWS ELB') AND source.outboundpeers > 10) AND dest.resource IN (RESOURCE WHERE role != ('Database'))

RQL Operators
An operator in RQL is one or more symbols or words that compare the value of a field on its left with one or more values on its right, such that only valid results are retrieved and displayed to you. You can use an RQL operator to find a specific term included as a value within an object or an array in a JSON.
The following operators and conditions that you can use to compare or validate results:
 Operators Within JSON Arrays  Config and Event Operators  Joins  Functions
Operators Within JSON Arrays

OPERATOR @ and ?
&& and ||

DESCRIPTION

RQL EXAMPLE

@ and ? are expressions used to filter arrays.
 ? opens the array.  @ represents the current
item being processed. It is used to hone in on a particular block in the json object so that you are only matching that block and no others.

config where api.name='aws-
ec2-describesecurity-groups' AND
json.rule='ipPermissions[? (@.fromPort==0)].ipRanges[*]
contains 0.0.0.0/0'

Combine conditions within json.rule using && and ||.

config where api.name = 'aws-s3api-
get-bucket-acl' and json.rule = "policy.Statement exists and policy.Statement[?

For Event queries, use the boolean operators Matches and Does not Match to match or not match field values against simple patterns and not full REGEX.
Patterns can have substrings and * for wild character search.

In the following example, the operation MATCHES 'c*login' enables you to list activities that match clogin, cloudlogin, or consolelogin.
event where cloud.type = 'aws' AND cloud.account = 'RedLock Sandbox' AND operation MATCHES 'c*login'

Joins
Joins allow you to get data from two different APIs where you have combined different conditions. You can use Joins only across config where queries, and can include up to three configuration API resources with alias X, Y and Z. Joins across event, network, and config are not supported. Join basic syntax:
config where api.name=".." as X; config where api.name="..." as Y; filter "$.X... <operator> $.Y"; show (X;|Y;)
To find EC2 instances that have public IP addresses assigned at launch use this query: Steps: 1. List EC2 instances as X:
config where api.name = 'aws-ec2-describe-instances' as X;
2. List subnets as Y:
config where api.name = 'aws-ec2-describe-subnets' as Y;
3. Set the filter:
filter '$.X.subnetId == $.Y.subnetId and $.Y.mapPublicIpOnLaunch is true'; show X;
4. Complete the query to list instances in subnets which have public IP addresses auto-assigned:
config where api.name = 'aws-ec2-describe-instances' as X; config where api.name = 'aws-ec2-describe-subnets' as Y; filter '$.X.subnetId == $.Y.subnetId and $.Y.mapPublicIpOnLaunch is true'; show X;

Examples of Joins:

DESCRIPTION VPCs that are connected to internet gateways.

RQL EXAMPLE
config where api.name = 'aws-ec2describe-internet-gateways' as
X; config where api.name = 'awsec2-describe-vpcs' as Y; filter
'$.X.attachments[*].vpcId == $.Y.vpcId and $.Y.tags[*].key contains IsConnected and $.Y.tags[*].value contains true'; show Y;

Functions
A function performs a calculation on specific data that matches the clause contained in the function and displays true results. Functions support auto-complete when you enter the prefix_ in a json.rule or addcolumn attribute.
Prisma Cloud supports following functions:
 _DateTime Examples  _AWSCloudAccount.isRedLockMonitored Examples  _IPAddress.inRange Examples  _Port.inRange Examples
_DateTime Examples
Query time ranges are not part of RQL grammar, and the query time window is passed as a separate argument to the query APIs. The selection of the attributes or columns for a category are not part of the RQL grammar.
The query time ranges that are available are _DateTime.ageInDays, _DateTime.ageInMonths, _DateTime.ageInYears, and _DateTime.daysBetween. The _DateTime.daysBetween function looks for any information that falls in between two dates and takes two dates as arguments.
When using the _DateTime function all json parameters are available as auto-complete options, you must select only parameters that have timestamps. Also, the syntax for a

DESCRIPTION

RQL EXAMPLE

List AWS Route53 Public Zones that have Private Records.

In this example, the IPAddress.inRange("172. %d",16,31) allows you to search for IP addresses that are in the range "172.16.x.x" to "172.31.x.x":

config where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-route53-list-
hosted-zones' AND json.rule = resourceRecordSet[*].resourceRecords[*].value any start with _IPAddress.inRange("172.%d",16,31)

_Port.inRange Examples
To check if a particular port number is part of a specific range, use class Port and method inRange. This method takes three arguments <fromInteger>, <toInteger>, and you can optionally include an <offset>.
By default, the <offset> is 1.

DESCRIPTION

RQL EXAMPLE

Use the inRange function with the contains and does not contain operators to check for conditions on a port range.
Specify <fromInteger> and <toInteger> to find all ports within the specified range.

Example using contains to check for ports numbers between 22 and 33 with an offset of 1:
config where api.name = 'aws-ec2describe-security-groups' AND
json.rule = ipPermissions[*].toPort exists and ipPermissions[*].toPort contains _Port.inRange(22,33,1)

The example above checks for all ports between 22 and 33.

Example using Does not Contain:

config where api.name = 'azurenetwork-nsg-list' AND json.rule =
securityRules[*].sourcePortRanges[*] does not contain _Port.inRange(350,5400,5)

The example above checks for ports 350, 355, 360, .....5390, 5395, 5600.

Example using no offset, to find all ports within the specified range:

config where api.name = 'aws-ec2describe-security-groups' AND
json.rule = ipPermissions[*].toPort

RQL FAQs
The following are answers to frequently asked questions.  Is time range part of grammar?
Query time ranges are not part of grammar. Instead, the query time window is passed as a separate argument to the query APIs. The selection of what attributes or columns of a category are returned are not part of the RQL grammar.  Is aggregating of query results supported? Aggregating, limiting, or formatting of query results are not supported.  Are cross joins supported? Joins across Event, Network, and Config are not supported. Joins are supported across Config queries only, and you can include up to three joins.  Why can't I see auto-complete suggestions when using functions? Autocomplete suggestions are not supported for function parameters. Autocomplete suggestions are also not supported for some attributes.  What is the correct way of grouping or breaking negated clauses within the json.rule? Use De Morgan Laws when grouping or breaking negated clauses within the json.rule. For example, to separate the conditions, use (not ($.x is true)) or (not ($.y is true)) instead of (not ($.x is true and $.y is true)) Similarly, if you want to use separate clauses use (not ($.x is true)) and (not ($.y is true)) instead of (not ($.x is true or $.y is true)).  How do I use quotation marks in a JSON rule? When you use the json.rule attribute, you can use specify the match conditions in the expression using single quotation marks, double quotation marks, or without any quotation marks. You can for example, say: json.rule = encrypted is true, or json.rule = `encrypted is true', or json.rule = "encrypted is true" The query output is the same whether you enclose it in quotation marks or not, the main difference is that the expression is validated only when you build the query without quotation marks. If you use functions or are matching data within an array, you must use single or double quotation marks. And if you have used a single quote in an array condition, use a double quote to enclose the expression. For example, json.rule = "ipAddress[?(@.x=='a')].port".  Can we apply primitive operators to a set of values? RQL Operators allow you to specify a condition using an integer, string, or boolean in an RQL query to a set of values within an array or a list. The list of primitive operators supported are ==, !=, >, <, is true, is false. On the Left Hand side (LHS) of an RQL expression, you can include a value or a set of values, and on the Right Hand Side (RHS) provide the value at the leaf which is typically a value that can be an integer, character, boolean or null.
50 PRISMATM CLOUD RESOURCE QUERY LANGUAGE (RQL) REFERENCE | Prisma Cloud RQL Reference

is any one of them exactly equal to

!=

is any one of them not equal to

>

any greater than

<

any less than

is true

any true

is false

 How do we use the operator MATCHES in Event RQL?
Use the boolean operators Matches and Does not Match to match or not match field values against simple patterns (and do not use regular expressions). A pattern can include substrings and * to support wild characters.
In the following example, the operation matches 'c*login' enables you to list all activities that match clogin, cloudlogin, or consolelogin:

event where cloud.type = 'aws' AND cloud.account = 'RedLock Sandbox' AND operation MATCHES 'c*login'
 Which are some constructs that are used across config, network, and event queries?  bytes or packets Use bytes to search for network related information by the aggregate byte or packet volume while the transmission lasts. For example, to search for network traffic generated by IP addresses that are coming from the public internet or from suspicious IP addresses:
network where source.publicnetwork IN ( 'Internet IPs' , 'Suspicious IPs' ) and bytes > 0
To identify traffic from internal workloads to public IP addresses on ports 8545,30303 that are known to mine Ethereum:
network where dest.port IN (8545,30303) and dest.publicnetwork IN ('Internet IPs' , 'Suspicious IPs' ) and packets> 0
 operation An operation is an action performed by users on resources in a cloud account. When you type the name of the operation that you are interested in, auto-suggest displays the options that match the search criteria. For example, to view all operations such as deletion of VPCs, VPC endpoints, and VPC peering connections:
event where operation in ( 'DeleteVpc' , 'DeleteVpcEndpoints' 'DeleteVpcPeeringConnection' )
 protocol

PRISMATM CLOUD RESOURCE QUERY LANGUAGE (RQL) REFERENCE | Prisma Cloud RQL Reference 51
 2019 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

You can search for network traffic based on protocols. For example, to search for network traffic from any public IP address that uses the TCP protocol and where the destination port is 21:
network where source.ip=0.0.0.0 AND protocol='TCP' AND dest.port IN (21)  role
Use role to filter the network traffic by resource roles. For example, to show all network traffic from any public IP address in a specific cloud account where the destination resource role is not AWS NAT Gateway and AWS ELB:
network where cloud.account = 'Redlock' AND source.ip = 0.0.0.0 AND dest.resource IN ( resource where role NOT IN ( 'AWS NAT Gateway' , 'AWS ELB' ))
To view traffic originating from suspicious IPs and internet IPS which are hitting the resource roles AWS RDS and Database:
network where source.publicnetwork IN ( 'Suspicious IPs' , 'Internet IPs' ) and dest.resource IN ( resource where role IN ( 'AWS RDS' , 'Database' ))
 tag Use tag to filter the network traffic with a specific tag. For example, to find all resources that are tagged as NISP to which you network traffic: network where dest.resource IN ( resource where tag ('name') = 'NISP')
 user To search for operations performed by specific users, use user. For example, to view all console login operations by Ben: event where operation = 'ConsoleLogin' AND user = 'ben'
 addcolumn Use addcolumn to dynamically display columns for the Config queries results that are displayed on screen. To add columns for key name and image ID for EC2 instances, for example:
config where api.name = 'aws-ec2-describe-instances' addcolumn keyName hypervisor imageId
