Dynamic and Hybrid Analysis
Key motivation for us:  More robust detection: Learn general
malware characteristics  Enable novel detection vectors: E.g.,
image recognition for phishing detection  Automate repetitive tasks
Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning: Non-exact Matching, Aggregate/Preselect/Visualize etc.

1. Characters are converted to ASCII tokens
2. Tokens are embedded into multi-dimensional vectors
3. Forward layers or Recurrent layers can be utilized to generate features
4. Fully connected layers can be used to increase the model depth
5. A suspiciousness score is assigned based on the output of sigmoid output neuron or softmax layer
