· Implementation · Demo · Conclusion

Why API deobfuscation matters?
· Malwares hide functionalities by API obfuscation
· Commercial packers obfuscate API functions · Malware authors have their own API obfuscator
· No deobfuscation tools for some modern packers
· x64 packers · Custom packers

API obfuscation techniques in modern packers
· Dynamic API Obfuscation
· API functions are obfuscated during runtime · Instructions and addresses changes every run
Branch into a newly allocated block during execution time (obfuscated User32.dll :MessageBox)

API obfuscation techniques in modern packers
· Static API Obfuscation
· API functions are obfuscated compile(packing) time
· Instructions and addresses are the same
Branch into other section
......
API Call by `ret' instruction

API Deobfuscation Goal
· After deobfuscation, we have
· (Near) original entry point · Recovered API function calls at OEP
· With the deobfuscated image, we can do
· Static analysis with disassembled and decompiled code
· Dynamic analysis with debuggers

· Dynamic API Obfuscation
 Memory Access Analysis
· Static API Obfuscation
 Iterative Run-until-API Method
· How to evade anti-debugging?
· Dynamic binary instrumentation (Intel Pin) · Anti-anti-debugger plugin in debuggers · Emulators

API Deobfuscation for Dynamic Obfuscators
· Memory Access Analysis
· Relate memory reads on API function code and corresponding memory writes on obfuscated code
· Instruction addresses of obfuscated API function  Original API function
· Recover original API function by the obfuscated call target address

Dynamic Obfuscation Process

· What happens during runtime obfuscation?
· Runtime obfuscator reads each function, obfuscates each instruction, writes the obfuscated code into a newly allocated memory
· Each function is obfuscated in sequence

Memory Access Analysis
· How can we identify the original API function?
· Record every memory write before the next API function or DLL reads
· Limit the number of memory write for the last API function
Write Addresses before next API function reads
Obfuscated Function Instruction Addresses
Obfuscated API call target
address

How to find OEP

· Find OEP
· Record every memory write and execute · OEP is the Last written address that is executed · Check written memory blocks (1 block = 4
Kbytes) to save memory · OEP is in the original executable file sections

Packed Section

Packer

Unpacked instruction is written
Unpack code is executed

Execution address Of written blocks

Obfuscated Call Identification
· Search for intermodular calls at OEP by pattern matching
· Matched patterns may contain false positives · After target address resolution, misinterpreted
instruction disappears

Obfuscated Call Resolution
· Direct call resolution
· If the call targets are in the constructed map from obfuscated addresses to API function, modify call targets to the original API function address
· Generate a text file that contains resolved API function calls and OEP

Obfuscated Call Resolution
· Indirect call resolution
· Original segments (.text, .idata, ...) are merged into one segment by packing
· Identify a memory block that contains successive obfuscated API function addresses
· Modify obfuscated call addresses in the IAT candidate with the original API function

Obfuscated Call Resolution
· Example: API Deobufscation Information
Addresses are in RVA

Debugging Deobfuscated Binary
· Generating a debugger script to resolve API calls
· The text file generated by the memory access analyzer contains OEP, resolved obfuscated addresses
· Implemented a python script to generate a debugger script that execute until OEP and resolve obfuscated addresses

Reversing with API Deobfuscator
· Debugging x86 binary with Ollydbg after running deobfuscation script

Reversing with API Deobfuscator
· Decompiled code with dumped file

API Deobfuscation for Static Obfuscators
· Static obfuscation pattern at OEP
· Obfuscated call pattern
· "Call qword ptr [___]" is changed into "Call rel32" when obfuscated
· Obfuscated call run into API function
· Stack shape is preserved · API call instruction and the first few instructions in
the API function are obfuscated · After executing obufscated instructions, execution
reaches an instruction in the original API function

Obfuscated Call Identification
· Search obfuscated call by pattern
· CALL rel32 ­ is a candidate · Check whether the address is in another section
of the process
Call rel32; db 00 `00' after call break alignment so thataA few incorrect disassembled code occur
......

Obfuscated Call Resoultion
· Obfuscated code is executed until API function
· Run-until-API method
· Change RIP into candidate API call address · Run until API function
Obfuscated Call Start
......
Execute until API address is met

Obfuscated Call Resolution
· Integrity check
· We need to check whether the stack pointer and the stack content is preserved after executing obfuscate call
Check Stack Pointer
Check Stack & Return Address

Iterative run-until-API Method
· Apply run-until API method repeatedly on candidate obfuscated calls
· Save context & Restore
....

Iterative run-until-API Method
· Iterative run-until-API method can be applied to various packers
· VMP: API function call is virtualizationobfuscated
· Themida64: API function call is mutated · Obsidium: The first few instructions in an API
function are obfuscated · Custom packers · But, at last, execution is redirected into a real
API function

Reversing with API Deobfuscator
· Debugging x64 binary with x64DBG after deobfuscation

Reversing Packed Binary with API Deobfuscator
· Packed 32/64 bit samples · Commercial packer packed 32bit malware

Conclusion
· Suggested two methods for API deobfuscatoin
· Memory access analysis for dynamic obfuscation
· Run-until-API method for static obfuscation
· Commercial packer protected binary can be analyzed using API deobfuscator
· Using debugger · Using disassembler & decompiler

Limitation
· Depending on DBI tools
· Packers can detect DBI tools
· Defeating the transparency feature of DBI (BH US'14) · Ex) Obsidium detect Intel Pin as a debugger
· DBI tools crash in some applications
· Static whole function obfuscated code cannot be deobfuscated
· No instructions in the original API function is executed when the whole function is obfuscated

Future Work
· Anti-anti-debugging
· Building x86/64 emulator for unpacking
· API function resolution
· Code optimization and binary diffing for static whole function obfuscation
· Backward dependence analysis for custom packers
