Where The "Industry" Is...

SCADA Became Popular.

Threats Began Adapting & Changing.

SCADA Started Trading in Dark Corners...

Vulnerabilities Continued...

Why Attack SCADA?!

Guardian AST...dafuq is it?

Not All Tanks Are Created Equal
 Gas Station Tanks  Backup Generator Tanks  Terminal Station Tanks  Other Tanks?

Introducing Gaspot
 HD Moore published his findings on Guardian's that are Internet facing  Software based gas pump monitor honeypots  Created to better understand attacks against gas pump monitor
systems and non-critical infrastructure  Derived from Anonymous' attacks against US based gas pumps  Completely virtualized  One Python script  Accepts robust input/output
 6 commands

Architecture

Deployment Locations

Code Considerations

Gaspot on Shodan

Shodan and Gaspot Consideration
 Not  all  Gaspot  instances  are  on  Shodan    Able  to  see  "organic"  growth  

Attack Scenarios
 DDoS, bringing inventory control/distribution to a standstill.  Change of pump names, resulting in incorrect fill of petrol into the
tank. (eg: change unleaded to diesel)  Change in pumping volume, resulting in over or under fill. (For
instance, putting the volume as full, when it is empty)  State sponsored, meaning a pump compromise to siphon off data for
possible espionage during a business deal?

Classification of attacks

What They're Not...
 Portscans  Successful telnet, then nothing  Server fingerprinting  Banner grabbing (HTTP GET)

What They Are...
 Successful commands resulting in possible failure
 Fat fingering after telnetting  Targeted malware  DoS and DDoS

Critical vs. Non-Critical Infrastructure
 Had a case study from 2013 showing attacks against critical infrastructure  Wanted to find out if attacks happen to non-critical infrastructure

Attacks- Critical Vs. Non-Critical
 Critical Infrastructure Honeypots 2013  Deployed in 8 countries  12 total deployments  74 Attacks in total
텻on- Critical Infrastructure Honeypots 2015
 Deployed in 7 countries  10 total deployments  18 Attacks in total

Intelligence...?

Syrian Electronic Army
 Came about in 2011  Supports President Bashar al-Assad  Performs DDoS, Defacements, malware distribution,
spamming, and general mischief  Defaced CBS, AP, NPR, BBC, Al Jazeera, etc.

DDoS "Attack"

 DDoS performed for two days  Volume based attacks (UDP floods, etc.)  Protocol attack (Fragmented packets)  Roughly 2Gbps
 Performed on Gaspot in US  Utilized what appears to be LOIC

 DDoS against Gaspot in US  No public disclosure by SEA?
 dafuq?  False flag?

Iranian Dark Coders
 Group operating out of Iran  Pro-Iranian group  Website defacements, information sharing, malware
distribution, and hacktivism

Modification "Attacks"
텶ranian Dark Coders? 5.106.221.208 2.147.147.123 5.219.58.67 31.14.94.33
