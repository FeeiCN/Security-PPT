Previous Related Work
 There is barely no previous research focusing on OLE internals, but we will mention two:
 "Attacking Interoperability"
 http://hustlelabs.com/stuff/bh2009_dowd_smith_dewey.pdf
 by Mark Dowd, Ryan Smith, and David Dewey in 2009  We named our presentation in honor of the great work
done in this paper
 Parvez Anwar's blog site has some work related to Office/OLE
 https://www.greyhathacker.net

OLE Is a Subset of COM
OLE
COM
OLE objects are COM objects that expose specific Interfaces. Must have: IPersistStorage IOleObject

OLE Internals
 To explain the OLE internals, first we need to understand what happens when a user opens a document containing OLE objects.

User opens the document

 User performs action on the OLE object (e.g., clicking, double-clicking)
or  "Verb" is performed automatically by Office features (e.g., PowerPoint animation)

OLE object initialized

"Verb" action performed

OLE Initialization

 Initializing/loading an OLE object can be done simply

via the ole32!OleLoad() API

HRESULT OleLoad(

_In_ LPSTORAGE _In_ REFIID

pStg, riid,

_In_ LPOLECLIENTSITE _Out_ LPVOID

pClientSite, *ppvObj

);

OLE Initialization
 We focus on the two major steps
 Step 1: calling CoCreateInstance to initialize the OLE object
 Step 2: calling IPersistStorage to initialize the OLE object's initial status (data)
 Next let's analyze the two steps in detail

Step 1: CoCreateInstance
ole32!wCreateObject+0x101: 75b41553 e8b387feff call ole32!CoCreateInstance (75b29d0b) 0018de38 0018de98 00000000 00000403 64c0c954 0:000> k 75b3f2af ole32!wCreateObject+0x101 75b3f1d4 ole32!OleLoadWithoutBinding+0x9c 632c4eb4 ole32!OleLoad+0x37 0:000> db poi(esp) 0018de98 02 26 02 00 00 00 00 00-c0 00 00 00 00 00 00 46 0:000> db poi(esp+4*3) 64c0c954 12 01 00 00 00 00 00 00-c0 00 00 00 00 00 00
CoCreateInstance(CLSID, NULL, CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER | CLSCTX_INPROC_HANDLER | CLSCTX_NO_CODE_DOWNLOAD, IID(IOleInterface))

Where Does CLSID Come From?
 The CLSID comes from the document, indicating which OLE object the user wants to initialize
 Because Office/WordPad supports a couple of document file types, locating the CLSID varies
 Office Open-XML format (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx, .ppsx, etc)  RTF (.rtf)  Office Binary format (.doc, .xls, .ppt, pps, etc)  Office even supports HTML format
 We are going to give examples in the Open-XML format and RTF

CLSID in Open-XML Format
 For Open-XML Format, the CLSID is read from the "OLESS" binary data file

CLSID in RTF
 For RTF, it uses the outdated OLE 1.0 format to define an OLE object
 https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd942402.aspx
 Specifying the CLSID is done via specifying the corresponding ProgID, in "\objdata" RTF control word*
 ProgID will be "translated" to CLSID at runtime via CLSIDFromProgID
*If the ProgID is invalid, and the following native data follows the OLESS format, the CLSID will be read from the OLESS native data

Step 2: IPersistStorage::Load

ole32!wCreateObject+0x1f9:

75b3eb41 ff5118

call dword ptr [ecx+18h]

ds:0023:6fb614a8={packager!CPackage::Load (6fb66171)}

0:000> k

75b3f2af ole32!wCreateObject+0x1f9

75b3f1d4 ole32!OleLoadWithoutBinding+0x9c

5c0e4eb4 ole32!OleLoad+0x37

 The container calls the "Load()" method on the OLE object's IPersistStorage interface to initialize its initial status

Step 2: IPersistStorage::Load
 https://msdn.microsoft.com/enus/library/windows/desktop/ms679731(v=vs.85).aspx
 IID: 0000010a-0000-0000-C000-000000000046
Load the initial "status" for the OLE object when it's being initialized

Storage Data
 It really depends on the OLE object for handling the IStorage--loading its initial status  As the code for implementing the IPersistStorage interface sits in the OLE provider (OLE object)
 The Storage Data (represented in the "IStorage" parameter) is stored in document file
 Like the "CLSID" field, it's also from the document file (which the attacker supplies)
 But there are differences
 OLE container (Office/WordPad) reads the CLSID in order to instantiate the OLE object
 OLE container reads the Storage Data and passes it to the OLE object, which is responsible for processing the data

Storage Data in Office Open-XML
 Represented in OLESS data file
 The following example shows the Storage Data for Flash Player OLE object
 CLSID: D27CDB6E-AE6D-11CF-96B8-444553540000  Read Storage Data from OLESS data file (oleObject1.bin)  Read from the "Contents" section

Storage Data in RTF
 Represented in OLE1 Native Data  Described here: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-
us/library/dd942053.aspx

A Short Break

 We have explained the two key steps in OLE Initialization
 Next, let's take a look at the "Verb" action

User opens the document

 User performs action on the OLE object (e.g., clicking, double-clicking)
or  "Verb" performed automatically by Office features (e.g., PowerPoint animation)

OLE object Initialized

"Verb" action performed

CoCreateInstance

IPersistStorage::Load

OLE "Verb" Action
 In essence, performing "verb" action is just calling the IOleObject::DoVerb on the OLE object
 IOleObject
 https://msdn.microsoft.com/enus/library/windows/desktop/dd542709(v=vs.85).aspx
 IID: 00000112-0000-0000-C000-000000000046  24 methods on this Interface
 There are a few parameters for this IOleObject::DoVerb method, but we need to focus only on the first one: the "iVerb," which under certain scenarios can be controlled by the attacker
 For example, via PowerPoint Show files (.ppsx, .pps)

IOleObject::DoVerb

packager!CPackage::DoVerb:

731e580c 8bff

mov edi,edi

0:000> dd esp

Agenda
 What Is OLE?  Historical Zero Days Involving OLE  OLE Internals  Attack Surface  Conclusion

Attack Surface via Document
 So, what may an attacker possibly perform in a document-based attack via OLE?
 We need to understand what data an attacker may supply from documents  Is the attacker able to supply the CLSID for CoCreateInstance during OLE Initialization?
 Answer: Yes (explained)
 Is the attacker able to supply the Storage used in IPersistStorage::Load() during OLE Initialization?
 Answer: Yes (explained)
 Is the attacker able to supply the "verb" id during OLE "Verb" Action?
 Answer: Yes (explained)

Attack I - IPersistStorage::Load
 It's the most obvious one
 You want to parse some data; I give you the crafted data  Sometimes it will result in memory corruptions;
sometimes it may be a logic bug
 In fact, most of the previously disclosed OLE vulnerabilities were actually in the IPersistStorage::Load() function
 Let's give some examples

CVE-2012-0158
 Lots of previous analysis has shown this, in MSCOMCTL.OCX
 But, where does the routine really come from?

CVE-2012-0158
 Tracing back, we arrive here
 What is the function sub_276008D9 really?

CVE-2012-0158
 After some REing, we realize this is exactly the "IPersistStorage::Load" method
 Indeed, the stack-based overflow exists in the IPersistStorage::Load method

"Package" Temp File Dropping
 Reported in McAfee Labs blog in July 2014
 https://blogs.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/dropping-files-tempfolder-raises-security-concerns
 Demo: http://justhaifei1.blogspot.com/2014/08/demonstrationof-windowsoffice-insecure.html
 Still unpatched!  Recently, James Forshaw leveraged the "feature" in the
exploitation of an NTLM Reflection EoP vulnerability he discovered: https://code.google.com/p/google-securityresearch/issues/detail?id=325
 The issue also exists in the "IPersistStorage::Load" function

"Package" Temp File Dropping
0:000> r packager!CPackage::EmbedReadFromStream+0x2c6: 733c404d call packager!CopyStreamToFile (733c6974) 0:000> du poi(esp+4) 04fdc008 "C:\Users\ADMINI~1\AppData\Local\" 04fdc048 "Temp\dwmapi.dll" 0:000> k 733c4aaa packager!CPackage::EmbedReadFromStream+0x2c6 733c627e packager!CPackage::PackageReadFromStream+0x6b 7749eb44 packager!CPackage::Load+0x10d

Attack II: IOleObject::DoVerb
 This is the "iVerb" param for the IOleObject::DoVerb
 The value of the "iVerb" can be defined in some place the attacker can control. For example: PowerPoint Show)

Attack II: IOleObject::DoVerb
 The attacker can supply the "iVerb" value and call the "IOleObject::DoVerb" method automatically
 For example, via the PowerPoint Show "Animations" feature
 Different values will result in different actions. For example:
 You give value 0, it performs predefined action 0, maybe opening the object
 You give value -1, it performs predefined action -1, maybe doing something else

Attack II: IOleObject::DoVerb
 OLE objects can choose not to implement their own IOleObject but use the default/standard interface
 Thus resulting in some standard "verb" actions  See next
 However, there are also a number of OLE objects that chose to implement their own IOleObject
 An action the developer implemented but that may be abused by bad guys
 Usually logic issues

Standard "Verb" Actions
 https://msdn.microsoft.com/enus/library/windows/hardware/z326sbae(v=vs.71).aspx

The Sandworm Zero Day
 The "Sandworm" zero-day attack (CVE-2014-4114) was the first ever exploit targeting this "IOleObject::DoVerb" vector

When "verb" is 3 Performing "context-menu" actions!

The Sandworm Zero Day
 What could possibly be wrong?
 The "context-menu" options for different file types are different
 The file content as well as the filename (file type) are controlled via "IPersistStorage::Load"
 Remember our "Package" Temp File Dropping case study? They are the same!
 So, this neat zero-day actually leveraged two attack vectors
 For example, installing an .inf
 Pwned! Logic bug!

Attack III: CLSID-Associated DLL Loading
 So, we have discussed two important attack vectors for OLE: IPersistStorage::Load and IOleObject::DoVerb
 Are there any more?
 Definitely
 Let's review the very first step of loading an OLE object
 Calling the CoCreateInstance trying to initialize the OLE objects, the OLE object is specified by CLSID, which is provided in the document file
 What does CoCreateInstance do? The following:
CoGetClassObject(rclsid, dwClsContext, NULL, IID_IClassFactory, &pCF); hresult = pCF->CreateInstance(pUnkOuter, riid, ppvObj) pCF->Release();
 CoGetClassObject needs to first load the DLL associated with the CLSID into the process

What Is "CLSID-Associated" DLL?
 A DLL has an associated CLSID in your Windows Registry
 HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID
 The "InprocServer32" key specifies where the DLL ("server") is

Attack III: CLSID-Associated DLL Loading
 What could possibly be wrong here?
 From an attacker's perspective?
 As we've discussed, OLE objects are a subset of COM objects, which is another subset of CLSID-associated objects
 Many COM objects registered in the OS are not OLE objects
 Several hundreds vs. several thousands
 Sometimes even a DLL that has a CLSID associated in the Windows Registry is not necessarily a COM
 But, CoCreateInstance will still load the CLSIDassociated DLL in the process
 Regardless wether it is an "OLE DLL"  The loaded DLL won't be unloaded, even if it's determined
later not to be an "OLE DLL"

Attack III: CLSID-Associated DLL Loading
 This is a *design* problem in the process of initializing OLE objects on Windows, in our opinion
 Without loading the DLL first, you won't be able to know whether the COM exposes the interface you want!
 Let's compare it with its well-known "sister" feature: the ActiveX Controls in Internet Explorer
 Unlike OLE, IE11 loading an ActiveX Control (say, in IE) will first result in checking the "preapproved" list  HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Ext\PreAp proved
 So, if the ActiveX CLSID is not in the list, the DLL won't be really loaded into the IE process  No problem for ActiveX in IE

Consequences
 What bad things might happen due to the problem we discussed?
 We can load any DLL into the process as long as the DLL is associated with a CLSID
 Considering the attack is launched via a document
 There are quite a few
 Note: Loading OLE DLL may also have the same problems. But, being able to load every CLSIDassociated DLL increases the attack surface *significantly*

Consequence 1: Non-ASLR DLL
 Loading non-ASLR DLL in container process
 Namely, Word, PowerPoint, Excel, WordPad  Thus used to bypass ASLR for exploitation
 Note, not only the CLSID-associated DLL may be nonASLR, but sometimes the CLSID-associated DLL could also link to other non-ASLR DLLs (so loaded as well)
 Does not work on Office 2013 and later because they enabled "Force ASLR"
 http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2013/12/11/softwaredefense-mitigating-common-exploitation-techniques.aspx
 Still works on Office <= 2010 and WordPad 

Example 1: otkloadr.WRAssembly.1
 Trying to load the "COM object" identified by ProgID:
otkloadr.WRAssembly.1
 It's not even a COM!

Example 1: otkloadr.WRAssembly.1
 Will load "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14\ADDINS\OTKLOADR.DLL," which will result in loading linked non-ASLR MSVCR71.DLL in the same directory
 Disclosed by Parvez Anwar in June 2014 at http://www.greyhathacker.net/?p=770, already fixed by Microsoft

Example 2: mscormmc.dll
 This non-ASLR DLL is on the default Windows 7
 C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v1.0.3705\mscormmc.dll
 A couple CLSIDs are associated on this DLL, for example:
 {18BA7139-D98B-43C2-94DA-2604E34E175D}
 Then make an Office document or RTF containing an OLE object with the CLSID. You will get the non-ASLR DLL loaded into the process
 Still works! Finding non-ASLR DLL made easy; found this in just a few minutes

Consequence 2: Memory Corruption
 Sometimes, loading an "unprepared" DLL is enough to trigger a memory corruption
 Example: Microsoft Office Uninitialized Memory Use Vulnerability (CVE-2015-1770)
 CLSID: CDDBCC7C-BE18-4A58-9CBF-D62A012272CE  Associated DLL: C:\Program Files\Microsoft
Office\Office15\OSF.DLL  Just trying to load the CLSID-associated DLL will give you
a crash (exploitable)!  The OSF.DLL is certainly not designed for you to load as
OLE or ActiveX Control  Discovered by Yong Chuan Koh of MWR Labs, more
details at
https://labs.mwrinfosecurity.com/system/assets/987/original/mwri_adviso ry_cve-2015-1770.pdf

Consequence 3: DLL-Preloading
 There's another attack scenario that hides in the deep
 Note, this is about document-based attacking
 The current working directory is something the attacker can control
 I shouldn't have to explain a DLL-Preloading attack should I?

DLL-Preloading Example: OLE Loading
 CVE-2015-2369 is a good example we reported, fixed just in July Patch Tuesday
 Minimal PoC in less than one tweet (140 bytes) 
{\rt\object\objocx{\objdata 010500000200000014000000574D444D434553502E574D444D43 4553502E310000000000000000000100000041010500000000000 0}}
 CLSID-associated DLL
 ProgID: WMDMCESP.WMDMCESP.1  CLSID: {067B4B81-B1EC-489f-B111-940EBDC44EBE}  DLL: %systemroot%\System32\cewmdm.dll
 Will result in loading a DLL named "rapi.dll" from the current working directory
 Demo!

Demo

Summary of Attacking Vectors
 Based on the time-flow of a victim opening the document, the attack vectors are:
I. Various types of attacks may occur during the "CLSIDassociated DLL Loading" process--the very first step of "OLE Object Initialization"
 Non-ASLR DLL loading  Memory Corruption  DLL preloading ...
II. Various types of vulnerabilities may exist in the "IPersistStorage::Load" routine, another step of the "OLE Object Initialization"
 A lot of zero-day attacks focus on this area
III. "Verb" action attack via "IOleObject::DoVerb"
 Usually logic bugs, more dangerous

Every Step Attacked

User opens the document

 User performs action on the OLE object (e.g., clicking, double-clicking)
or  "Verb" performed automatically by Office features (e.g., PowerPoint animation)

OLE object Initialized

"Verb" action performed
Attacked!

OLE DLL Loading (CoCreateInstance)
Attacked!

OLE Data Initialization (IPersistStorage::Load)
Attacked!

Summary of Attack Surface
 The OLE mechanism offers a huge attack surface
 Unlike ActiveX, an OLE object is not restricted by security enhancement features like "Pre-Approved List," Safe For Scripting (SFS), or Safe For Initialization (SFI)
 Being able to load any* CLSID-associated DLL makes the attack surface even much bigger
 Hundreds of OLE objects on default Windows  Thousands of CLSID-associated DLLs on default Windows
 Don't forget it's an open area!
 The more apps installed, the bigger the surface becomes  It's possible one day we'll see a document-based attack
targeting specific users having specific software installed on the system
*Note that the OLE-loading process honors the IE/Office Killbits, so if a CLSID is killbitted, the associated DLL will not be loaded.

Agenda
 What Is OLE?  Historical Zero Days Involving OLE  OLE Internals  Attack Surface  Conclusion

Conclusion
 The OLE mechanism serves the majority of Microsoft's documentation interoperability with other components
 A huge attack surface offered
 New ActiveX?  Even though it's not scriptable, it can do much more than
we expected
 What to expect next after the preso?
 Many OLE-related vulnerabilities will probably be discovered
 Probably more zero-day attacks targeting Office/WordPad  Detection and defense need to be improved*, for both
sandboxing and static approaches
 An OLE-specific detection method is on the way
*We have reported some new evasion tech recently (https://blogs.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/threatactors-use-encrypted-office-binary-format-evade-detection), suggesting the difficulties on detecting Office-based attack correctly.

Conclusion
 To vendor (Microsoft)
 The questionable "OLE Loading" mechanism needs to be revisited, maybe redesigned
 You can't just load every CLSID-associated DLL into the Office/WordPad process
 A large-scale internal pentest on the default OS is needed  New attacking vectors produce many new vulnerabilities
 Training third-party vendors  Just like what you have done before for ActiveX
