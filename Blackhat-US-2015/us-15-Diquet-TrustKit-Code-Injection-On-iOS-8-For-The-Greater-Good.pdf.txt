How It All Started
 iOS 8 released: dynamic libraries now allowed in App Store Apps!
 Lot of experience building Cydia "tweaks", which are dylibs
 At the time, we were thinking about building an SSL pinning library
 Can we create an SSL pinning tweak and package it in an App Store App on a non-jailbroken device?

Dylibs Before iOS 8
 Historically: no third-party dynamic libraries in Apps  System dylibs packaged with the OS
 Developer libraries: static linking only  Enforced via the App Store review process  Made library distribution complex (see: CocoaPods)  Security decision ?

Dylibs on iOS 8
 iOS 8: dynamic libraries now accepted  Apple calls them "Embedded Frameworks"
 Introduced to facilitate sharing code between Apps and their App Extensions  But... can be used regardless of whether the App actually has an Extension

Dylibs on iOS 8
 Mach-O is the file format for OS X and iOS programs and libraries.
 Executables interact with "dyld", the OS X and iOS dynamic linker to load libraries at runtime.
 A dynamic library is described in Mach-O binary in a "load command" structure

Dylibs on iOS 8
 Sandboxing requires that libraries are packaged within the app's bundle
 Unlike Substrate tweaks which are stored in /Library/
 dyld locates them through relative paths
 @executable_path prefix allows to locate libraries in paths relative to the main executable.
 @rpath prefix allows for multiple library search locations.
 In iOS, @rpath seems limited to one single location ("Frameworks" directory inside app's bundle)

Substrate Tweaks
 So can we package a Substrate tweak in an App?  For testing, tried packaging an existing tweak  ios-ssl-kill-switch  (In)security tool for disabling SSL validation and pinning  If it works, we can build our SSL pinning tweak!

Substrate in an App
 SIGKILL when calling MSFunctionHook()  Substrate hooks C functions by patching the function's prologue  This requires RWX memory pages  Not possible on a non-jailbroken device...  ...Unless running in a debugger

Substrate in an App
 We failed :(  No way to package a Substrate tweak in an App Store App due to RWX requirement
 Initial goal was to hook functions and patch an App at runtime on a non-jailbroken device  Any alternatives?

 Effortless SSL pinning for iOS and OS X  "Tweak" / runtime patch targeting SecureTransport
 Uses facebook/fishhook for C function hooking  Drag & Drop in Xcode
 Can be deployed without changing the App's source code  Needed a usable solution that works in real-world Apps
 Collaborated with the Yahoo mobile & security teams

SSL Pinning at Yahoo
 Goal: SSL pinning for Yahoo's mobile Apps  Easy project, right?
 But...  Technical challenges: What and how to pin?  Operational challenges: How to get buy-in from management?

SSL Pinning at Yahoo
 Goal: SSL pinning for Yahoo's mobile Apps  Easy project, right?
 But...  Technical challenges: What and how to pin?  Operational challenges: How to get buy-in from management?

Technical Challenges
 What to pin?  Certificate or public key?  Best practice is Subject Public Key Info  No API on iOS to extract SPKI from a certificate...
 Most libraries and examples are doing it wrong  Comparing the whole certificate or public key

Technical Challenges
 How to pin?
 Find and modify every single instance of NSURLConnection, NSURLSession ?
 Or better: use method swizzling
 Problem: no public API for customizing certificate validation in UIWebView
 Not even swizzling would work

Operational Challenges
 How to get buy-in from management?  Blocking attackers is a good cause but...  What if we block the wrong connections?
 Answer: a report-only mode  Shows what connections would be blocked and why  Easier to decide on whether pinning should be enforced or not

SSL Pinning at Yahoo
 No existing iOS library supported any of these requirements
 SPKI pinning
 Report-only mode
 Easy to deploy but works on all networking APIs
 Met with Data Theorem and started a collaboration :)

TrustKit
 We solved these challenges  SPKI pinning: ask the developer what the key's algorithm is  Easy configuration  Heavily based on HTTP Public Key Pinning  Works on all Apple APIs  Report-only mode  Format similar to HPKP for pin failure reports

Demo

TrustKit
 We're open-sourcing TrustKit today  Supports iOS 7+ and OS X10.9+  MIT license  Will also be available via CocoaPods very soon
 https://datatheorem.github.io/TrustKit/  Feedback, comments and pull requests very welcome!

Conclusion
 TrustKit is already live in a Yahoo App on the App Store  Partnered with other companies who will deploy it in their OS X and iOS Apps
 Used our experience in offense to build a defensive library  Code injection, function hooking  Could be applied to other things than SSL pinning?

One Last Thing
 SSL pinning can be a challenge for security researchers
 And is not designed to block an attacker running code as root on the device...
 So I also just released SSL Kill Switch 2
 https://github.com/nabla-c0d3/ssl-kill-switch2
 Added support for TrustKit Apps (and OS X)

Thanks!
