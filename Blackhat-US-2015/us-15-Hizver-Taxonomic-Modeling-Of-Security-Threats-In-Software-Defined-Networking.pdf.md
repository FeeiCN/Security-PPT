Taxonomic Modeling of Security Threats in
Software Defined Networking
Jennia Hizver PhD in Computer Science

Agenda
 SDN Adoption Rates  SDN Attack Surface  SDN Threat Model  Attack Examples  Threat Mitigation

SDN Adoption Rates
 By the end of 2016, more than 10,000 enterprises worldwide will have deployed SDN in their networks (Gartner, 2014)
 75% of the surveyed companies planned on SDN deployments in the next 5 years (Gartner, 2014)
 The worldwide SDN market will reach $8 billion by 2018 (International Data Corporation, 2014)

Security of SDN
 Limited knowledge on SDN vulnerabilities, threats, and attacks  Increased architecture complexity => increased risk  Vendors jumping on the SDN bandwagon => no time for secure
SDLC  No existing SDN threat identification framework

Threat Actions
 "A threat is any event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations and assets ... through an information system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, or modification of information, and/or denial of service." - NIST Special Publication 800-30
 Threat Actions:  Unauthorized access (ACC)  Unauthorized disclosure (DISC)  Unauthorized modification (MOD)  Disruption of service (DISR)  Unauthorized destruction (DEST)

Threat Mitigation
 Determine what threats have to be mitigated  Specify security requirements to address the threats  Implement the mitigation measures

Threat Mitigation Examples
TH: Conduct brute force login attempts/password guessing attacks against the management console SR: A management console shall not allow any user to successfully use a password guessing attack to gain unauthorized access MM: All vendor default passwords for management consoles should be changed
TH: Exploit a known information disclosure vulnerability in the NBI SR: An application shall not allow any user to successfully exploit a vulnerability to access information which the user is not authorized to access MM: All application server patches should be applied in a timely manner
.

Threat Mitigation Examples
TH: Conduct communications interception attack against the EWI SR: The east/west bound interface shall not allow unauthorized users to eavesdrop on network communications between the controllers MM: The east/west bound communication channels should be protected using strong cryptography
TH: Cause a denial of service on a controller SR: A controller shall not allow any network element to successfully use a denial of service attack to reduce its availability MM: Rate limiting and packet dropping at the controller plane to avoid denial of service attacks. Specific rules should be installed on the network elements where the attack is being originated.

High-Level Recommendations
 Allow only required ports and services in the controller  Limit the number of accounts requiring direct access to the controller  Implement HA controller architecture  Integrate the SDN specific user accounts with the enterprise IM infrastructure  Place the management interfaces in a dedicated virtual network segment  Implement SDN patch management practices  Use strong encryption to protect SDN communication channels  Follow secure coding practices for all applications  Validate NE flow tables against the controller to identify discrepancies  Implement integrity checks on controllers  Implement security monitoring and security policy enforcement of SDN
elements  Enable logging and audit trails

BlackHat Sound Bytes
 Our current knowledge on SDN threats and attacks is limited. To better anticipate potential SDN threats at the early design stage, enterprises could use the presented SDN threat model
 The proposed framework could be further extended by incorporating the details of specific SDN designs. It could also serve as a foundation for planning and carrying out SDN penetration tests
 The model enables comprehensive development of security requirements and mitigation measures to increase the state of preparedness in the event of attacks on SDN
