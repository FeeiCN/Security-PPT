About Texplained

Texplained
[Technology Explained]
refers to the skill of making sense out of any IC in a black box
situation
Invasive attacks
Invasive attacks are left out of evaluation and certification mainly
because of the extensive resources needed
Whereas Invasive attacks are a major threat as:
 Piracy and counterfeiting have merged  Hackers groups are getting professional
Texplained focuses on performing invasive analysis using the technologies developed in house to perform complicated analysis in a short amount of time

Expertise in Texplained comes from 10 years of active R&D experience
for an independent security research laboratory focused on demanding pay-tv security

Background
Secure Microcontrollers
 This talk will focus on secure microcontrollers.  A secure microcontroller is an Integrated Circuit (IC) with an
integrated CPU, program memory and storage for sensitive data.  Secure microcontrollers are available in different form-factors:
 Smartcards, biometric passports and ID cards  SMD packages for TPMs, uSD, UMMC  Members of a particular product family will share device characteristics.

Background
Evaluation
 When it comes to invasive attacks, one can argue that the attack is time and ressource consuming.
 BUT equipment can be rented and / or service labs can provide support
 There is no clearly defined process to study one IC in a reasonable time
 Invasive Attacks are under evaluated

The problem
A clone of a PayTV subscriber card will have the same level of access as the genuine subscriber card. Pirates can buy a single subscription with access to all the paid content and then produce copies of this card.

Reading The Flash
 Flash is easy to spot :  Charge pump used to erase it relies on big capacitors  Charge pump can be disabled to prevent a flash erase in case of security interrupt.
Flash Memory
25

Reading The Flash
 Flash output buffers are directly visible from the backside
 Output lines get separated in 2 groups that travel along the flash to the core.

Reading The Flash
 Only one of the flash output could be traced to the core.
 Position of the other output is approximative.
Flash output going inside the core
27

Reading The Flash
 Tracing the known flash output leads to 2 multiplexers.

Reading The Flash

 It also shows that bytes can be handled in different orders (endianness...)

Attack Strategy For Reading The Flash
 Instruction register is made of Flip-Flops that have 2 interesting signals:  clk / read signal that can be used to synchronize data as some clk cycles may be suppressed by embedded counter-measures  Enable signal that disconnect the input from the Flip-Flop.
 Redundancy can be obtained by probing 2 data lines at a time (one needle will stay on its line for all the acquisition).
 4 needles Linear Code Extraction
33

Comparison with old ICs

 Linear Code Extraction is still a valid attack scenario.
 Old chips had no protection against it.
 The target hides its bus logic inside a dense core
 This obfuscation does not help when the attacker can fully reverse the core.

External Flash Buffers
34

Attack Strategy For Reading The Flash

 Performing the attack can be tricky depending on :
 shield technology
 Position of the interesting nets inside the chip (frontside or backside edit)
 Planarization
 Having all features extracted, a gds2 file has been created. It can be loaded in the FIB for assisted navigation.

Reading The ROM
 Getting the  raw  bits is feasible.  Is the ROM encrypted?

Dopant etch

36

Reading The ROM
 ROM data bus goes to an encryption bloc
 Having Muxes and Flip-Flops on the same path may indicate that decryption operation can take several clk cycles.
 This path has not been completely reversed
 ROM can be read after studying the encryption without any Focused Ion Beam edit.

Timing : generation benchmark

 The first Linear Code Extractions did not require expensive equipments such as FIB and SEM.
 The main memory was not scrambled neither encrypted.
 Buffers were easily accessible.
 Extracting such a chip would require very little effort nowadays.

Flash Outputs

 New methodology is already successful
 Time of this particular study is short
 Deprocessing and imagery can be performed in less than 2 weeks.
 Interconnects are extracted and the result checked in another 2 weeks.
 The tools used for that study were in a mode used when picture quality is low or when feature extraction has not been verified.
 Standard Cell Library has been extracted while tracing signals, leading to 22.000 extracted instances inside the core.
 Tracing RAM, ROM and Flash to the Instruction Register and verifying its location with an overview of the Instruction decoder took 1,5 week.

Conclusion
 The target IC has the characteristics of a secure chip.  Shield  Internal Oscillator  Memory encryption  Obfuscation of the different parts inside a single core ...
 Linear Code Extraction would be the best method to read the main memory
 ROM could be read by a deep Hardware Reverse Engineering
46

Conclusion
 Time necessary to perform the study was 2 weeks of feature extraction related work and an extra week and a half to find where and how to perform a Linear Code Extraction.
 This methods speeds up the regular process by a significant factor.  It also opens doors for semi-invasive attacks where the position of
important standard cells could be used to narrow down one study.  Hardware custom implementation are questionable.
