Advanced SSL/TLS: Improved Security
 CloudFront uses high security ciphers

 Employs ephemeral key exchange
 Enables Perfect Forward Secrecy

CloudFront Edge location

Advanced SSL/TLS: Improved Performance
 Session Tickets
 Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP Stapling)

Session Tickets
 Session tickets allow client to resume session
 CloudFront sends encrypted session data to client
 Client does an abbreviated SSL handshake

CloudFront Edge location

OCSP Stapling
1) Client sends TLS Client Hello
2) CloudFront requests certificate status from OCSP responder
3) OCSP responder sends certificate status
4) CloudFront completes TLS handshake with client
5) Request/response from Origin Server

Validate Origin Certificate
 CloudFront validates SSL certificates to origin  Origin domain name must match Subject
Name on certificate  Certificate must be issued by a Trusted CA  Certificate must be within expiration window

But there are things you need to do

Deliver Content using HTTPS
 CloudFront makes it easy
 Create one distribution, and deliver both HTTP & HTTPS content
 There are other options as well:
 Strict HTTPS
 HTTP to HTTPS redirect

CloudFront TLS Options

 Default CloudFront SSL Domain Name
 CloudFront certificate shared across customers
 When to use?
 Example: dxxx.cloudfront.net

 SNI Custom SSL
 Bring your own SSL certificate

 Dedicated IP Custom SSL
 Bring your own SSL certificate

 OR use AWS Certificate Manager  OR use AWS Certificate

 Relies on the SNI extension of the Transport Layer Security protocol

Manager  CloudFront allocates

dedicated IP addresses to

 When to use?

serve your SSL content

 Example: www.mysite.com  Some older browsers/OS do not
support SNI extension

 When to use?
 Example: www.mysite.com  Supported by all browsers/OS

Integrated with AWS Certificate Manager

Before (time-consuming & complex)

After (simple & automated & super fast)

3-5 days
3rd Party Certificate Authority

Upload to IAM via AWS CLI

Connect to CloudFront via AWS CLI

AWS Certificate Manager

End-to-end process within minutes

Using a couple of mouse clicks on the console

MapBox

MapBox uses SNI Custom SSL
 They wanted to use a custom domain  xxxxx.mapbox.com
 Their clients support TLS  They wanted to use an economical option

HTTPS Usage Patterns
 Half bridge TLS termination  Full bridge TLS termination

Half Bridge TLS Termination
 Better performance by leveraging HTTP connections to origin

CloudFront

HTTP

region

Full Bridge TLS Termination
 Secured connection all the way to origin  Use origin `Match Viewer' or `HTTPS Only'

Amazon CloudFront

HTTPS

region

MapBox uses multiple origins
 Have multiple API endpoints (origin servers)
 One with Half Bridge: HTTP from Edge to Origin
 Second with Full Bridge: HTTPS from Edge to Origin

You are not done yet...
You need to protect content cached at the Edge

Access Control
 What if you want to...
 Deliver content only to selected customers  Allow access to content only until `time n'  Allow only certain IPs to access content

Access Control: Private Content

 Signed URLs
 Add signature to the Querystring in URL  Your URL changes

 Signed Cookies
 Add signature to a cookie  Your URL does not change

 When should you use it?  Restrict access to individual files  Users are using a client that doesn't
support cookies  You want to use an RTMP distribution

 When should you use it?  Restrict access to multiple files  You don't want to change URLs

Access Control: Private Content
 Here is an example of a policy statement for signed URLs

Access Control: Private Content
 Under development mode?  Make CloudFront accessible only from your
"Internal IP Addresses"

You are still not done...
What if you want to restrict access based on parameters in the request?

Threat Analysis

AWS WAF example: A technical implementation
 Blocking bad bots dynamically with AWS WAF web ACLs

AWS WAF Example: Blocking Bad Bots
 What We Need...  IPSet: contains our list of blocked IP addresses  Rule: blocks requests if requests match IP in our IPSet  WebACL: allow requests by default, contains our Rule
 and...  Mechanism to detect bad bots  Mechanism to add bad bot IP address to IPSet

AWS WAF Example: Detecting Bad Bots

 Use robots.txt to specify which areas of your site or webapp should not be scraped
 Place file in your web root
 Ensure there are links pointing to nonscrapable content
 Hide a trigger script that normal users don't see and good bots ignore

 $ cat webroot/robots.txt  User-agent: *  Disallow: /honeypot/
 <a href="/honeypot/" class="hidden" ariahidden="true">click me</a>

AWS WAF Example: Blacklist Bad Bots

 Bad bots (ignoring your robots.txt) will request the hidden link
 Trigger script will detect the source IP of the request
 Trigger script requests change token
 Trigger script adds source IP to IPSet blacklist
 WebACL will block subsequent request from that source

 $ aws --endpoint-url https://waf.amazonaws.com/ waf getchange-token

{



"ChangeToken": "acbc53f2-46db-4fbd-

b8d5-dfb8c466927f"

}

 $ aws --endpoint-url https://waf.amazonaws.com/ waf update-ipset --cli-input-json '{ "IPSetId": "<<IP SET ID>>", "ChangeToken": "acbc53f2-46db4fbd-b8d5-dfb8c466927f", "Updates": [ { "Action": "INSERT", "IPSetDescriptor": { "Type": "IPV4", "Value": "<<SOURCE IP>>/32" } } ] }'

Origin Best Practices

 1. Match Viewer Origin Protocol Policy
 Enable Only TLS 1.1 or 1.2 to Origin
 Enforce HTTPS Only Connections to Origin

 2. Restrict Access using Security Groups & Shared Secret

 3. Use a SHA256 certificate

Origin Best Practices

 4. Use ELB with Custom certificate

 5. Use ELB Pre-defined Policy  6. Send HSTS Header

 *Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=15552000;
 *X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
 *X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block Options

You can request an SSL Certificate from AWS Certificate Manager
