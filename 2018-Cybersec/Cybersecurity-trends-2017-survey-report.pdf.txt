MOBILE SECURITY & BYOD
Mobile computing is changing the world. The number of connected devices has grown by 30% year-overyear and is not expected to slow down in 2017. Further driving change is user preference for their smartphones, personal computers, tablets, and other computing technologies.
Allowing employees to use their own devices can certainly improve satisfaction, but it also puts the organization at risk for additional security threats. Whether these devices are sanctioned or not through a corporate BYOD program, IT departments need to grapple with setting unified policies especially when it comes to securing mobile devices and the information they access.

MOBILE SECURITY THREATS

The dramatic growth of mobile devices is driving an increase in cybercrime, from stolen identities to major data breaches. Forty-seven percent of respondents observe either a moderate rise (30%) or significant rise (17%) in mobile device threats. Very few respondents (14%) see modest or significant decreases in mobile threats.

The impact of mobile threats is being felt in terms of added helpdesk workload and associated cost (26%), need for additional IT resources to manage mobile security (21%), and reduced employee productivity (12%).

ERP SECURITY
Just a few years ago, ERP security was a synonymous with separation of duties. Nowadays, leading analysts list ERP security as an increasingly important topic to protect the life blood of organizations processes and data managed in complex ERP systems.
ERP security has become a rapidly growing market as organizations start paying attention to this area of cybersecurity. This happened not least because of real cyber attacks against ERP platforms, first of all, the US-CERT alert addressing vulnerabilities in SAP, which hit headlines in 2016.

MOST CRITICAL BUSINESS APPLICATIONS
The three most critical business applications are at the core of organizations' business functions - any disruptions can immediately and significantly impact revenue: Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is considered the most critical business application by 61% of respondents. This is followed by financial systems (57%) and customer relationship systems (CRM) (55%).

DATA & FILE PROTECTION
Data is the lifeblood of IT systems, services, and applications. It is also the ultimate target of attacks to steal, sell, manipulate, erase, or corrupt sensitive data and the systems that process it. Data protection needs to encompass a comprehensive strategy for protecting information assets from application/ user errors, malware attacks, machine failure, or facility outages/disruptions along the information lifecycle. This also includes the secure transfer of files, be it for backup or corporate projects. Today, email is still the most common file transfer method for smaller files ­ yet one of the least secure methods.
Sixty-seven percent of survey respondents ranked data encryption as the most effective means for protecting against cyber security attacks.

MOST SENSITIVE INFORMATION
Securing sensitive information is a key concern for all companies, also driven by regulation that require certain sensitive information be protected. Cybersecurity professionals are most concerned about protecting customer data (72%), employee data (66%), and email (54%). Sales and marketing data is considered least critical to be secured (21%). Robust protection of sensitive data at rest and in motion through encryption and other methods is paramount to organizations security strategy.

FILE TRANSFER CHALLENGES

Security is the number one concern (59%) when transferring files, followed by sending large files (44%) and tracking file transfer success (36%).
Q: Which challenges do you face when transferring files?

Over half of IT security professionals confirm they lack the tools to prove compliance related to transfer of sensitive files. Secure file transfer solutions should include not only proper file encryption and access controls but also detailed audit logs for maintaining compliance ­ ideally automated as to reduce the potential for human error.
Q: If your file sharing practices were audited for regulatory compliance, do you have the tools you need to streamline the process?

MANAGED & OUTSOURCED SECURITY SERVICES
Our research shows that about half of organizations deploy a mix of inhouse and outsourced IT security. Companies turn to outsourced and managed security services providers to alleviate the pressures they face, such as assessing and remediating against new types of attacks, protecting their organization against data theft, and addressing skills shortages and filling resource gaps.
Outsourced security services include a range of professional services such as assessments, penetration testing, and other advisory services. Managed security services are provided by a third party (MSSP) on behalf of the client, including 24/7 network monitoring and management of security controls, overseeing patch management, and responding to emergencies.

BENEFITS OF OUTSOURCING SECURITY

The two most frequently mentioned benefits organizations have realized from managed security services are improved security and reduced cost ­ two of the main drivers for organizations looking to outsource information security. Improved availability, flexible capacity and scalability, and increased efficiency round out the top 5 benefits. These findings confirm that organizations generally receive the overall benefits promised by managed security providers.
