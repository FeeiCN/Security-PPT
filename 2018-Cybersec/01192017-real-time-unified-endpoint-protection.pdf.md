(Ransomware) File-less Attack
One of a "file-less" attack scenario

1.Browser-based drive-by infection, e.g. infected ad
2.Malicious software initiates its communication to its C2
4.Advanced (Ransomware) Malware executes on the victim's machine memory, NOT on HD/Disk. This is a file-less, memory-based attack

3.C2 delivers Ransomware to the victim machine

SentinelOne Dynamic Behavior Tracking Engine Detects and Protects endpoints from File-less, memory-based attacks.

Many Attack Vectors ...
Malware
 Ransomware, trojans, worms, backdoors
