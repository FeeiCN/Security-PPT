So, what's our approach?
16 |  2017, Palo Alto Networks. Confidential and Proprietary.

A holistic, integrated and automated approach...

 All applications  All users  All content  Encrypted traffic  SaaS  Cloud  Mobile

 Enable business apps
 Block "bad" apps
 Limit app functions
 Limit file types  Block websites

 Exploits  Malware  Command &
control  Malicious
websites  Bad domains  Stolen
credentials

 Static analysis  Machine
Learning  Dynamic
analysis  Bare metal
anaylsis

...and consistent across ALL locations!

Threat Prevention

CVE-2017-0144 (TID 32422) MS17-010 (TID 32494, 32424, 32427, 32393, 32716, 32422)

Traps Local Analysis prevention Prior to attack

2:30 am : WildFire protections deployed Traps prevents the execution of ransomware
2:34 am: AutoFocus tag created Threat analytics and hunting enabled

Alerts to 3rd party solutions
WildFire:  Identifies and Prevents
new malware and exploits with continuous analysis  Provides protection feeds every 5 mins
AutoFocus:  View into WildFire data for
latest analytics and hunting  Extraction of relevant IoCs to deploy automated preventive measures
NGFW  Threat Prevention for
vulnerability exploit and known malware protection  Real-time monitoring, logging and reporting
Traps  Preemptively blocks
known and unknown malware and exploits  Automates prevention by reprogramming itself using threat Intelligence from WildFire

RISKS
So, where do we....

Zero Trust

Zero Trust Design Concepts
 Focus on the business crown jewels (data)  Design security from the Inside -> Out
 Start with the assets or data that need protection
 Determine who or what needs access
 Need to know/least-privilege
 Inspect and log all traffic
