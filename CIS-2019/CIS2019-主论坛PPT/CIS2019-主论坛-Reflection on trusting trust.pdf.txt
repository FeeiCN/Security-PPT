What I am about to describe is one of many "chicken and egg" problems that arise when compilers are written in their own language.

Self-reproducing program (Quine)
More precisely stated, the problem is to write a source program that, when compiled and executed, will produce as output an exact copy of its source.

Self-reproducing program (Quine)
 "Hello World\n"  [This] is an idealization of the code in the C compiler that interprets the character escape sequence. This is an amazing piece of code. It "knows" in a completely portable way what character code is compiled for a new line in any character set. The act of knowing then allows it to recompile itself, thus perpetuating the knowledge.
