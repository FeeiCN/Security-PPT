The development of Windows 8 followed the Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)
which defines best practices for secure software design, implementation, and
testing.

Windows 8 includes new protections against root and boot kits. UEFI systems
prevent malware from starting before Windows and protects the remainder of the boot process, including early launch
antimalware software.

Windows 8 includes numerous security features, such as mitigations, that make it difficult and costly for malware authors to develop reliable exploits for vulnerabilities.

Windows Defender is shipped with every edition of Windows 8 and Internet
Explorer's Application reputation features have been moved into the platform such that users are protected regardless of the
browser they use.

Most systems are not compromised by exploits

 About 6% of MSRT detections were likely caused by exploits [29]
 Updates were available for more than a year for most of the exploited issues [29]

Most exploits target third  11 of 13 CVEs targeted by popular exploit kits in 2011 were for issues

party applications

in non-Microsoft applications [27]

Most exploits target older versions of Windows (e.g.
XP)

 Only 5% of 184 sampled exploits succeeded on Windows 7 [28]  ASLR and other mitigations in Windows 7 make exploitation costly [30]

Most exploits fail when mitigations are enabled

 14 of 19 exploits from popular exploit kits fail with DEP enabled [27]  89% of 184 sampled exploits failed with EMET enabled on XP [28]

Exploits that bypass mitigations & target the latest products do exist

 Zero-day issues were exploited in sophisticated attacks (Stuxnet, Duqu)  Exploits were written for Chrome and IE9 for Pwn2Own 2012

Bottom line: we must continue to increase the cost of exploitation for attackers

ASLR in Windows 8 takes advantage of the large address space (8TB) of 64-bit processes

High entropy bottom-up
randomization

 1 TB of variance in bottom-up start address  Breaks traditional address space spraying (heap/JIT)  Processes must opt-in to receive this behavior

High entropy top-down
randomization

 8 GB of variance in top-down start address  Automatically enabled if top-down randomization is on

High entropy image
randomization

 Images based above 4 GB receive more entropy  All system images have been moved above 4 GB

Outcome: probability of guessing an address is decreased and disclosures of memory addresses must include more than the low 32 bits

The general design of the Windows heap is unchanged in Windows 8
HeapAlloc(heap, flags, size)
Frontend allocator (LFH)
Used for sizes <= 16KB
Backend allocator
Used by frontend and for sizes less than 512K (x86) or 1MB (x64)
Virtual memory allocator
Used by backend and for large allocation sizes
Kernel memory manager 25

Change in Windows 8

Impact

LFH is now a bitmap-based allocator

LinkOffset corruption no longer possible [8]

Multiple catch-all EH blocks removed

Exceptions are no longer swallowed

HEAP handle can no longer be freed

Prevents attacks that try to corrupt HEAP handle state [7]

HEAP CommitRoutine encoded with global Prevents attacks that enable reliable

key

control of the CommitRoutine pointer [7]

Validation of extended block header

Prevents unintended free of in-use heap blocks [7]

Busy blocks cannot be allocated

Prevents various attacks that reallocate an in-use block [8,11]

Heap encoding is now enabled in kernel mode

Better protection of heap entry headers [19]

Outcome: attacking metadata used by the heap is now even more difficult
