Mt.Gox Then a major Bitcoin-trading website

2014  2

Unknown attackers exploited a Mt. Gox's wallet software design flaw to record fake transactions. The flaw allows these attackers to make a withdrawal from their own account and tamper with the record of that transaction. So they could cash out, but claim they never received the Bitcoins.

Impact:
Suspended trading, closed its website and exchange service, and filed for a form of bankruptcy protection

850,000 bitcoins belonging to customers and the company were missing and likely stolen, an amount valued at more than $450 million at the time.

Flexcoin A Bitcoin bank

2014  3
Impact: Hackers stole 896 bitcoin, worth 365,000, and Flexcoin was forced to close after the attack
2016  |  

On 2 March 2014 Flexcoin was attacked and robbed of all coins in the hot wallet. The attacker first created a new Flexcoin account and deposited some bitcoins into it, then successfully exploited a flaw in the code which allows transfers between Flexcoin users by sending thousands of simultaneous requests, the attacker was able to `move' coins from one user account to another until the sending account was overdrawn, before balances were updated. This was then repeated through multiple accounts, snowballing the amount, until the attacker withdrew the coins.

2015  1
Impact: Loss of 19,000 bitcoins, approx $5m worth; forced to shut down for almost one week to fix problem
2016  |  

Attackers used Skype and email to communicate with employees and attempt to distribute files containing malware by appealing to their personal histories and interests. Bitstamp's system became compromised after one systems administrator downloaded a file that he believed had been sent by a representative for an organization that was seeking his membership. Bitstamp suspended operations to investigate the attack, rebuilt its website, deployed new hardware, and implemented other measures to make stealing bitcoins more difficult.

Impact: Lost as much as 185,000 ethers and 250 bitcoins, worth approx. $2.14m; the website was offline due to the attack
2016  |  

Experienced a cyberattack on its hot wallets that resulted in the loss of funds.
"We have previously communicated the fact that most clients' crypto-asset funds are stored in multi-signature cold wallets. However, the malicious external party involved in this breach, managed to alter our system so that ETH deposit transfers by-passed the multi-sig cold storage and went directly to the hot wallet during the breach period. This means that losses of ETH funds exceed the 5% limit that we imposed on our hot wallets."
