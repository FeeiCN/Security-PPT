They have some issues dividing them...

Threat Intelligence
"There's way too much uncertainty around her. I live & die in binary world." "I beat adversaries with STIX & detonate their remains. She plays with numbers." "People say she's "stochastic." That explains a lot; she needs serious help." "She doesn't even cyber, bro! Need I say anything more?"
6

Risk Management
"He's intolerable. I assess he needs to be treated & transferred to a 3rd party." "One look at his laptop makes me panic. It's a giant audit finding with a keyboard." "He never shares with coworkers. I swear, if he TLP-Red's us one more time..." "What's his deal with China, anyway? It's an HR liability if you ask me."

What is threat intelligence?

"Evidence-based knowledge, including context, mechanisms,
indicators, implications and actionable advice about an existing or emerging menace or hazard to assets that can be used to inform decisions
regarding the subject's response to that menace or hazard."

"The details of the motivations, intent, and capabilities of internal and external threat actors. Threat intelligence includes specifics on the tactics, techniques, and procedures of
these adversaries. Threat intelligence's primary purpose is to inform business decisions regarding the risks and implications
associated with threats."

What is risk?

Loss Event Frequency

Probable Loss Magnitude

#RSAC
Risk management process (NIST 800-39)

Frame: establishes the context for risk-based decisions and strategy for execution

Assess

Assess: encompasses everything done to analyze and determine the level of risk to the organization.

Monitor: verifies proper implementation, measures
ongoing effectiveness, tracks changes that impact
effectiveness or risk, etc.
Monitor

Frame

Respond: addresses what organizations choose to do once risk has been assessed and determined

Finding Common Ground

#RSAC
Risky questions needing intelligent answers

What types of threats exist? Which threats have occurred? How often do they occur? How is this changing over time? What threats affect my peers? Which threats could affect us? Are we already a victim? Who's behind these attacks? Would/could they attack us? Why would they attack us? Are we a target of choice? How would they attack us?

Could we detect those attacks? Are we vulnerable to those attacks? Do our controls mitigate that vulnerability? Are we sure controls are properly configured? What happens if controls do fail? Would we know if controls failed? How would those failures impact the business? Are we prepared to mitigate those impacts? What's the best course of action? Were these actions effective? Will these actions remain effective?

Example risk assessment project
"During a recent audit, it was discovered that there were active accounts in a customer service application with inappropriate access privileges. These accounts were for employees who still worked in the organization, but whose job responsibilities no longer required access to this information. Internal audit labeled this a high risk finding."

Description

Motive

Financial, Intermediary

Primary intent Engage in activities legal or illegal to maximize their profit.

Sponsorship

Non-state sponsored or recognized organizations (illegal organizations or gangs).

Targets

Financial services and retail organizations

Capability

Professional hackers. Well-funded, trained, and skilled.

Risk Tolerance Relatively high; however, willing to abandon efforts that might expose them. Prefer to keep their identities hidden.

Methods

Malware, stealth attacks, and Botnet networks.

Crossing the Divide

#RSAC
Making it work in your organization
1. Initiate communication between intel & risk teams 2. Orient intel processes & products around desired risk factors 3. Identify threat communities of interest and create profiles 4. Establish guidelines & procedures for risk assessment projects 5. Encourage ongoing coordination & collaboration
 Create centralized tools/repositories
