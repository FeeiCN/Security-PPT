Tonsillectomies in 1930
"It is a little difficult to believe that among the mass of tonsillectomies performed to-day all subjects for
operation are selected with true discrimination, and one cannot avoid the conclusion that there is a tendency for the operation to be performed as a
routine prophylactic ritual for no particular reason and with no particular result."

Mammary Artery Ligations in 1955
"Both the patients who did have their mammary arteries constricted and those who didn't reported immediate relief from their chest pain. In both groups
the relief lasted about three months--and then complaints about chest pain returned. Meanwhile, electrocardiograms showed no difference between those who had undergone the real operation and those
who got the placebo operation."
Predictably Irrational, Dan Ariely, 2009

Modern Security Medicine
Doctors were recommending the procedure and patients were having the procedure, regardless of its effectiveness
The expected results of the procedure did not match with the actual results,
but no one noticed or changed anything

The Status Quo
Penetration Testers are our experts Methodologies built from experience and intuition Application Security programs focused on fixing bugs Continuous loop of discovering and fixing issues Organizations continue to get owned

Penetration Testing Considered Harmful

Average Penetration Test
Results depend on which testers are available Results depend on your tester's mood Results depend on your kick-off call Results depend on your scope Testers focused on writing a "Nice Report" Testers focused on discovering cool vulnerabilities

Pentests Avoid Highly Likely Attacks
Penetration Testing Considered Harmful Haroon Meer, 2010, 44CON http://blog.thinkst.com/p/penetration-testing-considered-harmful.html

#RSAC
The Wrong Things In The Right Places
Penetration testing avoids highly likely attacks because the vulnerabilities that our penetration testers and our application security engineers find are not the vulnerabilities that real attackers find

Attackers

#RSAC
Everything You Know Is Wrong
Defenders make bad assumptions about attackers Defenders do not understand attackers Defenders are not profiling attackers correctly And that's why the attackers keep winning

Attacker Fallacies

Dumb Attackers

#RSAC
Insight From Offense
All attackers are resource constrained
Resourced constrained attackers favor low-overhead attacks
Low-overhead requires good scalability

#RSAC
Attacker Playbooks
Attackers that have multiple targets care about repeatability and scalability

#RSAC
Operational Efficiency
Playbooks depend on: Who their targets are Intended success rate How fast they need to convert

Attackers operate like efficient businesses
 Experts at the top  Employees are cheap and
complete simple tasks  Employees who don't
meet their goals are fired  Inefficient organizations
fail quickly

#RSAC
Penetration testers operate like hobbyists
 All employees are experts  Employees are expensive  Employees who do not
produce are hard to fire  Organizations that do not
produce do not fail  Customers rarely care
about output

#RSAC
Attackers
In defense, we mistake attacker efficiency for inadequacy We are not being effective against certain attackers because we don't understand how they operate

Case Study: Syrian Electronic Army
Also: Lizard Squad and Anonymous Politically-motivated, low-resourced attackers DNS hijacking by phishing DNS providers DDoS attacks with custom software Website defacing on shared hosting providers Conclusion: No web vulnerabilities used

Case Study: Elderwood
Also: PLA Unit 61398 State-sponsored, well-resourced attackers Mostly low reliability Internet Explorer bugs ASLR/DEP bypasses with Microsoft Office/Java Exploits delivered via phishing and watering holes Conclusion: Web vulnerabilities only when needed

Case Study: ShadowCrew
Also: Other organized crime groups Financially-motivated, well-resourced attackers Credit card data theft via SQL injection Typically targets one website at a time Scaled poorly with tools like sqlmap and havij Conclusion: One web vulnerability used at a time

#RSAC
Observations
Real attackers don't attack web applications (mostly) These vulnerabilities are not scalable and repeatable Attackers focus on inexpensive, but effective methods The only application security threat is sqlmap
(sqlmap is not much of a threat)

Conclusion
The security industry lacks a focus on accurate attacker methodologies during assessments

#RSAC
Future Work
We are only discussing application security
The same techniques can be applied to: Infrastructure Security and Lateral Movement Client-Side Security and Endpoint Security Reconnaissance and Social Engineering (Phishing)
