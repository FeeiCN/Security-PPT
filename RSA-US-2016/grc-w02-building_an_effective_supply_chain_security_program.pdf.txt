Supply Chain Security: What It Means
Supply chain security is a program that focuses on the potential risks associated with an organization's suppliers of goods and services
Attackers are focusing on this!
There are many ways that a supply chain breach could occur
Software compromise, credential theft, and more are becoming common scenarios

#RSAC
Supply Chain Breach Example: Target
Target experienced a significant breach of roughly 110 million customers' data, with at least 40 million payment cards stolen.
During the course of the investigation, it was found that Target was initially breached through a connection established by one of their vendors, HVAC vendor Fazio Mechanical Services

#RSAC
Supply Chain Breach Example: Home Depot
Home Depot, another large retailer, also claims that its credit card breach in 2014 was initially due to stolen credentials from a third-party vendor.
In many of the most public cases we have seen, the attackers have targeted personal data, health care information and financial data, such as debit and credit card details.

#RSAC
Supply Chain Breach Example: OPM
In 2015, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) revealed a significant breach of 22 million records including sensitive data tied to numerous federal employees, contractors and military personnel.
This breach, like many others, seems to have originated with stolen credentials from a background check provider that worked with OPM, KeyPoint Government Solutions

 Best Practices for Risk Management and Automation

Vendor Management:

#RSAC

Define Important Vendors

 Define Important Vendors
 "Important" vendors can mean many things
 These are vendors that:
 Are critical to business operations  Maintain unique or legacy components of importance  Provide critical services

Vendor Management:

#RSAC

Specify Primary Contacts

 Specify primary contacts
 Coordinate due diligence on vendors and report to senior leadership using a risk-based approach
 Maintain knowledge of, and compliance with, policies and reporting requirements.
 File documentation and paperwork with the legal and contracting teams to ensure there is a central repository and audit trail.
 Coordinate broad communication with those who can add value in vendor oversight

Vendor Management:

#RSAC

Establish Guidelines and Controls

 Policies should include:
 Requiring the right to audit and test the security controls of vendors and service providers annually, upon significant changes to the relationship and in response to audit requests or events
 Requiring vendors to adhere to security monitoring requirements
 Requiring periodic reports from the vendors and service providers demonstrating service level attainment and performance management
 Requiring vendors and service providers to provide timely notification pursuant to any security breaches or incidents that may cause impact to the organization

Vendor Management:

#RSAC

Integrate with Organization's Practices

 With the pieces in place, a vendor management program can now start to integrate with the organization's assessment and audit practices
 Depending on the industry, organization, and culture, these practices will vary widely

#RSAC
Supply Chain Security Best Practices

#RSAC
People, Process and Technology

#RSAC
Best Practices: People
 These should be in place at supply chain companies
 HR Teams: Background checks should be performed on a regular basis for both new and existing employees and contractors
 Every 6-12 months is ideal
 Monitor all staff that work with your organization's data and systems for changes to job status and requirements
 Access to critical systems should be monitored, and all third-party access should be revoked after a defined period of inactivity

#RSAC
Best Practices: Employment Agreements
 HR and security teams should verify that security requirements are clearly spelled out in contracts for supply chain personnel
 Acceptable use provisions should be in place for supply chain organization employees through their employment agreements

#RSAC
Best Practices: Process
 Create a supply chain assessment questionnaire and checklists:
 Application security  Audit and compliance  Business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities  Change and configuration management  Data security and data life cycle management  Physical (data center) security  Encryption and key management  Governance and risk management  Identity and access management (IAM)  Infrastructure and IT operations security  Threat and vulnerability management

#RSAC
Best Practices: Process
 Supply chain review should follow these guidelines:
 Decide on a list of controls with which supply chain organizations need to demonstrate compliance
 Determine the frequency of security reviews for internal and regulatory compliance needs
 Define a remediation and arbitration process for handling supply chain organizations that are not currently meeting security requirements

#RSAC
Process Best Practices: Code Review
 Code analysis of software should ideally be done for supply chain partners
 Having the code reviewed should ideally be the responsibility of the vendors, and they should attest to software security via a report issued prior to installation or updates
 Contracts should require this!
 Pen testing of software should also be allowed in contracts

#RSAC
Process Best Practices: Vulnerability Mgmt
 Supply chain vendors should have to provide patches to their products in a timely fashion
 Heartbleed, Shellshock, and others have affected us significantly  SLAs should be in place for patch creation
 Supply chain partners should be required to notify you of data breaches that may materially impact you
 Incidents should be communicated, too...could you be the next target?

#RSAC
Best Practices: Technology
 The first, and perhaps simplest, change is to begin using technology services that offer supplier risk ratings or rankings compared to other industry organizations.
 Monitoring the overall risk ratings of supply chain participants from other organizations working with them provides information on industry perceptions of security posture

#RSAC
Technology Best Practices: Privileges
 Vendors and partners with privileges should be controlled:
 Enforce separation of duties and least privilege for accounts  Implement strict password and account-management policies and
practices  Log, monitor, and audit all vendor/partner online actions  Consider a "sandboxed" approach for remote access
 Most importantly, all organizations need a policy and approach to managing and monitoring privileged users

#RSAC
Technology Best Practices: Network Isolation
 Network isolation and segmentation changes can help with improving supply chain security
 Remote attacks through supply chain access should be limited
 Careful zoning and network isolation with strategic access controls can help prevent this
 Multiple authentication points (while annoying) can be useful
 Logs and events from remote access systems (VPNs, etc.) should be carefully monitored
 Jump boxes and "thin client" approaches are also valuable

Technology Best Practices: Analytics+Threat

#RSAC

Intelligence

 Many organizations use or plan to use security analytics tools and threat intelligence to help identify and combat advanced attacks
 Analytics platforms provide:
 Deep data sets  Pattern recognition  Machine learning
 Threat intelligence can help to correlate information gleaned from internal sources with indicators of compromise spotted by other organizations

Technology Best Practices: Exfiltration

#RSAC

Monitoring

 Monitoring egress points from the internal network is another way to improve security within the supply chain today
 Some of the most common protocols and standards used for data exfiltration or command and control include HTTP/HTTPS, FTP/FTPS/SFTP, SSH, IRC, Email, P2P, and DNS or ICMP for covert channels
 Monitor at NGFW, IDS/IPS, Proxy, and in DNS

#RSAC
Wrapping Up

#RSAC
Applying What We've Discussed
Next week you should:
Review your existing vendor management/procurement capabilities
In the first three months following this presentation you should:
Update product and vendor inventories Define appropriate controls for different vendor types (check best practices discussed earlier)
Within six months you should:
Update risk assessment processes for vendor review Ensure all critical vendors have complete reviews & documentation
