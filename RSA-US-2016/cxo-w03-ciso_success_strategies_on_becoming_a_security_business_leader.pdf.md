Build Your Business Case

#RSAC
Why Create a Business Case?
Business case helps
 Leadership estimate the costs and benefits  Management determine resource allocations  Put requests in broader organizational context

#RSAC
Security Business Case Traps
"If we don't do this we'll get hacked" "It's the right thing to do" "This new technology will solve all our problems" "It doesn't cost that much" "Management doesn't get it"

#RSAC
Approaches to Building a Security Business Case
Cost Approach
 How much does it cost to recover from a data breach?
Industry Comparison Approach
 What are comparable firms doing and paying?
Business Innovation Approach
 What can I gain from doing this?

#RSAC
Cost Approach
Typically calculated using cost-per-record lost
Ponemon Cost of Data Breach Study
 $217 per record in 2015  $201 per record in 2014  $188 per record in 2013
These numbers include direct & indirect costs
 Engaging forensics experts, free credit monitoring  In-house investigations & communication  Extrapolated value of customer loss

#RSAC
Cost Approach Issues
Not always accurate
 Overestimates cost of large breaches  Underestimates cost of small breaches
Verizon applied cost-per-record approach to cyber insurance claims data
 Resulted in an estimated loss of only 58 cents per record

#RSAC
Ranges of Expected Loss
Verizon developed a modified log-scale approach

Industry Comparison Approach

Business Innovation Approach
 What can I gain from doing this?

#RSAC
Industry Comparison Approach
What is reasonable for security based on:
 Industry  Size  Region  Market position
 Value of IP and assets
Can be analyzed via
 Spending comparison  Maturity comparison

#RSAC
Spending Comparison
Percent of IT budget spent on security
 Provides only a rough understanding of performance  Research from Gartner
 5.1% in 2013  4.7% in 2012  4.2% in 2011
Can be a problematic metric
 Depends on what is included in the percentage  Spending averages may not be a fit for every org  Do not make this the sole or primary focus of your business case

#RSAC
Maturity Comparison
What are other companies doing?
 What is a reasonable level of maturity?  Can be very qualitative
Where to get comparable data?
 Information Sharing & Analysis Centers (ISAC)
 FS-ISAC, REN-ISAC, etc.
 Community projects
 BSIMM, OpenSAMM
 Research & consulting organizations
 Gartner, Big 4, security service firms, etc.

#RSAC
Need for a Security Framework
Security frameworks provide a blueprint for
 Building security programs  Managing risk  Communicating about security
Many frameworks share common security concepts
Examples include
 ISO 27000  COBIT  ENISA Evaluation Framework  NIST Cybersecurity Framework

NIST Cybersecurity Framework
Defines a common language for managing security risk
 Core has five Functions that provide a high- level, strategic view of the security life cycle
Helps organizations ask:
 What are we doing today?  How are we doing?  Where do we want to go?

#RSAC
Identify Protect Detect Respond Recover

#RSAC
Tips on Using the Cybersecurity Framework
Not everyone can or should implement the full Cybersecurity Framework immediately
 New programs  Small security teams  Small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs)
Useful as a way to frame the high-level components of your security program

#RSAC
Measuring Maturity

Can't do everything at once
 Need to define a progression of maturity

Implementation Tiers

 Defined in the Cybersecurity Framework

 Tier 4 - Adaptive  Tier 3 - Repeatable  Tier 2 - Risk Informed  Tier 1 - Partial

"Tiers do not represent maturity levels. Progression to higher Tiers is encouraged when such a change would reduce cybersecurity risk and be cost effective."

Need a way to measure maturity and determine where to invest

#RSAC
Maturity Models
Maturity models provide a standard way to
 Measure organizational capabilities  Identify areas of improvement
Examples include
 Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)  Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) Maturity Model  Gartner ITScore  Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model (C2M2)  Building Security In Maturity Model (BSIMM)  Open Software Assurance Maturity Model (OpenSAMM)  Capability Immaturity Model (CIMM)

#RSAC
Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)
Process model that defines what should be done to improve performance
 Originally created to improve software development practices  Now expanded to cover development, services, and acquisitions
Defines five maturity levels
 Widely recognized and understood by executives, business leaders, and technology managers

#RSAC
CMMI Maturity Levels

Level 5 Optimizing
Level 4 Managed
Level 3 Defined
Level 2 Repeatable
Level 1 Initial

Focus on continuous process improvement Processes are measured and controlled
Processes defined for the organization and are proactive
Processes defined for projects but are reactive Processes are ad-hoc, chaotic, not repeatable Success requires competence and heroic effort

#RSAC
Business Innovation Approach
Plan security investments based on:
 Business opportunities
 Key enterprise initiatives  Process improvement opportunities  New product support
 Business requirements
 Compliance, regulatory
 Business risk
 Annualized Loss Expectancy

#RSAC
Rocket Your Relationships

#RSAC
Stakeholder Management Strategy
Understanding the business is not just about understanding the goals of the company
It's also about understanding key stakeholders, their motivations, interests, and power
As you become more successful in your career, the initiatives you run will affect more people
It's likely your work will impact people who have power and influence over your projects These people can support or block you

#RSAC
Understand Stakeholder Motivations
Stakeholders are both organizations & people
Identify the specific individuals within each group They may have different views of your project So you need to tailor your approach
Stakeholders can affect your efforts because they have:
Power to "veto", "vote", or "voice" their opinions Interest in the work performed
Understand stakeholders by following a three-step process

#RSAC
Understand Stakeholders
Meet with them and others who know them to understand
What motivates them? What do they want from you? What interest do they have in your work? What can you provide to them? Who do they trust? Who advises them?

#RSAC
Mapping Power and Interest
Full understanding of stakeholder power and interest can be achieved through stakeholder mapping
Stakeholders have:
Three levels of power
Those with a "veto" Those with a "vote" Those with a "voice"
Three levels of interest
High Medium Low

#RSAC
Prioritize Stakeholders
Power/Interest Grid can be used to prioritize your stakeholders

Example #1: Heartbleed - Bad
Heartbleed is a bug in the OpenSSL cryptography library, the widely used TLS protocol. Heartbleed may be exploited regardless of whether the party using a vulnerable OpenSSL instance for TLS is a server or client. It results from improper input validation in the implementation of the TLS heartbeat extension. This vuln is classified as a buffer over-read.
Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed
32

#RSAC
Example #1: Heartbleed - Better
A security vulnerability called "Heartbleed" was disclosed Monday night, which could impact our websites. This bug allows private data such as usernames, passwords, and credit card numbers to be stolen from the memory of a website's server. Our security team immediately began scanning our environment for potential impact. At this time, there is no indication that our company is at risk, or has been compromised.
33

#RSAC
Example #2: DMARC - Bad
DMARC is an email validation system designed to detect email spoofing by providing a mechanism to allow receiving mail exchangers to check that incoming mail from a domain is authorized by that domain's administrators and that the email (including attachments) has not been modified during transport. It expands on two existing mechanisms, the well-known Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), coordinating their results on the alignment of the domain in the From: header field, which is often visible to end users. It allows specification of policies (the procedures for handling incoming mail based on the combined results) and provides for reporting of actions performed under those policies.
Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMARC
34

#RSAC
Example #2: DMARC - Better
The solution prevents scammers from sending fraudulent email to our customers. These fraudulent emails result in stolen usernames, passwords, and fraudulent transactions. The solution reduces the number of stolen accounts by 20%, account fraud by 10%, and the total amount of fraudulent transactions by $1 million.
35

#RSAC
Example #3: DDoS - Bad
DDoS is an attack where multiple compromised systems, which are often infected with a Trojan, are used to target a single system causing a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. Victims of a DDoS attack consist of both the end targeted system and all systems maliciously used and controlled by the hacker in the distributed attack. The DDoS attack uses multiple computers and Internet connections to flood the targeted resource. DDoS attacks are often global attacks, distributed via botnets.

#RSAC
Example #3: DDoS - Better
On Friday night our primary web site was unavailable for two minutes because it was flooded with traffic from the Internet by cyber attackers. We immediately instituted our incident response and recovery procedures and the web site was made available with zero customer impact.
