Encryption is Good...and Not Sufficient

In cryptography, encryption is the process of encoding messages or information in such a way that only authorized parties can read it.

Dynamic Diversity of Threats

1. Customer Service Rep uses a webbased translation service
2. Site vulnerability is exploited and malware loaded into the browser
3. New session opens and sophisticated malware is installedinterrogates the workstation
4. Attempts to capture claim information to use for phishing attacks on aerospace companies

1. Spanish company selling hacking tools is hacked releasing source code identifying 4 exploits of Adobe Flash
2. Adobe releases patches
3. Threat actor based in China sends phishing emails to senior executives encouraging them to click to install the Adobe patch

1. Large cache of stolen credentials released publicly via Pastebin
2. Some of the released credentials used for 3rd party sites and enterprise log ins
3. A few of the credentials are from privilege users

The cyber threat landscape is changing too quickly for frameworks to respond to

A bull black market
The black market of health care data from a cyber economic perspective

#RSAC
A Bull Black Market

There are two black markets: one for common traders and one for nation states and organized crime syndicates. The two markets rarely interact and have different market dynamics.

Maintaining value
 Health care data has a long shelf life on the black market.
 Health care data provides fuller data set than the financial sector (e.g., SSN, medical history, employee information).

Change in price behavior
 In 2014, PHI sold for $3-$50 per record. In 2015, $5-$700.
 The most valuable fields within a data set are SSN, name, and DOB.
 Hackers haven't realized the real market value of health care data due to information asymmetries.
 Unlike traditional supply and demand economic model, the price of health care data is dependent on the threat actor's use of the stolen data, not the volume of the data stolen.

Increasing supply
 Amount of data stored across the industry.  Interactions with health care providers.  Total cybersecurity incidents targeting this industry.
The supply of data on the black market is misleading due to dueling black markets

Terms of Service - ToS

The average American encounters 1,462 privacy policies a year with an average length of 2,518 words.

I agree with the Terms of Service.

The privacy policy for one of the world's largest online payment systems is 36,275 words ... more than Shakespeare's Hamlet!

Walks in the Park Are No Longer Free ...

In the U.S., social networks are considered public spaces ... this means that you should have no expectations of privacy in the data collected.

 81% of divorce attorneys admit to searching social media for evidence
 70% of HR professionals have rejected a candidate based on information uncovered in an online search
 86.1% of police departments now routinely include social media searches as part of criminal investigations

Hey John,

Phishing eMail

It was great seeing you last week at the reunion. I'm sure

you didn't recognize me since I lost over 75 pounds from

our college days. BTW- you look great and I enjoyed

meeting your wife. Here is a picture from the reunion that

you'll get a kick out of!

All the best, Jane

The Most Popular Threat Vector is...

According to the 2015 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (VDBIR):

"One of the most effective ways you can minimize the phishing threat is through awareness and training."
--Lance Spitzner, Training Director, SANS Securing The Human

 Phishing was associated with 95% of incidents attributed to state-sponsored threat actors
 Over 100 million phishing messages arrive in our inboxes every day
 The median time-to-first-click came in at one minute and 22 seconds across all campaigns
What can we do?
 Improve education/awareness  Consider unconventional controls

Sinkhole Newly Established Domains

A sinkhole, also known as a cenote, sink, sink-hole,[1] shakehole,[2] swallet, swallow hole, or doline (the different terms for sinkholes are often used interchangeably[3]), is a depression or hole in the ground caused by some form of collapse of the surface layer
