Infusion Pumps
Infusion pumps are medical devices that deliver fluids and medications into a patient's body in controlled amounts. Infusion pumps among the most are ubiquitous connected medical devices in hospitals.
Estimated that more than 2 million infusion pumps are in use in hospitals.

All Devices Have Vulnerabilities

Although the vulnerabilities might not be known
Just because it's vulnerable doesn't mean it's exploitable
Patching may not be possible right away

Isolation

Defense in depth

Surround and protect the vulnerable

NCCoE Strategy

MISSION
ACCELERATE ADOPTION OF SECURE TECHNOLOGIES
Collaborate with innovators to provide real-world, standards-based cybersecurity capabilities that address business needs

VISION
ADVANCE CYBERSECURITY
A secure cyber infrastructure that inspires technological innovation and fosters economic growth

GOAL 1
PROVIDE PRACTICAL CYBERSECURITY
Help people secure their data and digital infrastructure by equipping them with practical ways to implement standards-based cybersecurity solutions that are modular, repeatable and scalable

GOAL 2
INCREASE RATE OF ADOPTION
Enable companies to rapidly deploy commercially available cybersecurity technologies by reducing technological, educational and economic barriers to adoption

GOAL 3
ACCELERATE INNOVATION
Empower innovators to creatively address businesses' most pressing cybersecurity challenges in a state-of-the-art, collaborative environment
