#RSAC
To Whom Should The CISO Report?

GENERAL COUNSEL

CEO

· Compliance focused

· Lack of time for security

· Legal Expertise Access

· Raises visibility of security

· Lack of technical understanding · May provide aid short-term

· Underestimation of costs

· Too many details for CEO

RISK OFFICER · Risk advocate

PHYSICAL SECURITY · Guns Guards vs IT culture

· Security may not get attention Increased incident comms

· Clout with senior management · "Police Mentality"

· Lack of business metrics

· Law enforcement connections

One Security Officer's Prediction (Mine!) for

#RSAC

the CISO of 2020

1. Must have a 2-3 year roadmap tied to new business opportunities/technologies
2. Incidents expected, controlled response expected 3. Controls compliance with control framework expected ­
pick one and go, all industry-mapped 4. Reports outside of IT, 'IT security' resides under
infrastructure group 5. SIEM, threat intelligence performed by cloud-providers 6. More CISOs sourced from the business 7. Focus on risk, where the data is and knows country-
specific privacy laws
