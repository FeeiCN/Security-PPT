Applying What We've Learned Today
You can't secure what you can't see. Get a handle on "shadow IT" and whether or not it represents unacceptable risk. Develop a SaaS security strategy if you haven't already
Not every cloud service has to be monitored. Do you want visibility and control from unmanaged devices?
Treat encryption / tokenization of data outside of SaaS provider with care Contract terms should be 1-2 years in this highly fluid market
