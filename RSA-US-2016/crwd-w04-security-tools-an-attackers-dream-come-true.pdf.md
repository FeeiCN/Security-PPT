#RSAC
Waking up from the security nightmare

#RSAC
Apply security policies on security products
Automated patching should be a MUST criteria Pen-test your security product
Don't place the security tools as "exceptions" If you see something, say something -> contact your vendor
Discover and disable unnecessary remote access services (SSH, FTP, Telnet etc.) Discover and enforce security tools remote destinations Monitor and treat security tools administration logs as indication of attack

#RSAC
Summary
Also the best of the security tools can be used as a double-edged sword Recognize that infiltration is inevitable More so, infiltration detection tools won't be able to stop these Work under the assumption that the threat actors is within Learn to prevent the breach itself
