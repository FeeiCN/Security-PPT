#RSAC
1. Technology decisions not reducing threat
2. Executives not understanding the threat
3. Inability to quantify investments to reduce threat

#RSAC
Where to begin...
 What are you trying to protect?

 Strategic direction should be

defined by the answer...

#RSAC
Threats and Attack Surfaces

Define the threats to your organization  Website hack  Malware  Insider  3rd Party

What is attack surface?  Employees with email and web surfing
access  Online storefront  Point of sale retail  Single database or secret source code

+

4

#RSAC
Create a maturity model based on your needs
 Identify security controls that mitigate the threats that you have identified  Measure yourself and create a `score' that clearly shows your maturity level  Prioritize the key threats your organization must mitigate  Socialize this with executive leadership for transparency and support of your
investments

Determining Success

 Create a ruler and measure
 Don't get caught arguing about the measuring stick; focus on left to right movement
 Don't be afraid to make commitments on the measure
 Understand what success looks like  CEO micromanaging your objectives  CFO asking how this investment moves me forward  Others being asked to create something like your model  M&A leader asking how NewCo measures up and what do you need to bring up to the standard

Selecting the optimal portfolio stack for your company

Define your architecture

+

10

#RSAC
 All tools you invest in must be able to work together, not just with other vendor supplied solutions
 The days of isolated tools and isolated functions have passed us
 Tools must be able to consume intelligence to provide context

Culture considerations
 You must manage expectations of your end users

#RSAC
 Don't underestimate the amount of education it will take for certain security technologies

 Culture awareness

needs to be

considered

 Government level

security is not always

necessary

Implementation and architecture

#RSAC
Understand your risk profile

 Not every company is highly regulated or driven by strict customer demands
 Your profile may not lend itself to full data loss prevention blocking on all channels and disallowing any remote access
 Don't over prescribe as credibility is key to success

+

16

#RSAC
Team

 What are your current talent capabilities
 Certain tool sets lend itself to trusting the protection provided vs. having the skillset to validate and constantly tweak
 If you build vs buy, consider cross training capabilities and retention of the talent to maintain

#RSAC
Communication across teams

 Most security technologies have a tremendous dependency other nonsecurity technologies

 Agent deployments, in-line network gear, email flow integration

 Must consider other teams

during the selection

process and get their buy-

in

Case Study: Blackstone Security Stack

#RSAC
Mission Statement
In response to the ever evolving threat landscape we recommend upending the traditional security paradigm:
prevent, detect and react and embracing an approach that balances prevention with:
Enhanced Visibility, Situational Awareness & Response combined with a business oriented approach to Information Risk & Security
+

#RSAC
Key Value Drivers
 The Blackstone Security Stack is a methodology that security leaders can use as reference guide and/or blueprint aid them in making decisions about their information risk & security program.
 The Blackstone Security Stack provides:  Security Guidance / Blueprint for guidance and technical security architecture that leans on ISO 27001 and the NIST Cyber Security Framework  Support in justifying purchase of security solutions, services, and SW/HW  A framework for budgeting, resourcing and other needs which enables benchmarking across companies  Flexibility enabling each security leader to adapt the security stack to properly protect their organization aligned with unique organization risks, budget, and needs
+

#RSAC
Addressing the challenging questions

 The Blackstone Security Stack should help answer common questions  What are my key threats?  Have I been compromised?  Am I making the right security investments at the right time?  What data do I need to inform and influence positive security outcomes?  What is the balance between Being Compliant and Being Secure?  Ultimately, do our controls align with our real threats and risks?

100 Day Plan Recommendation
Ensure the following is in place or established:  Senior management support
 Budget, resourcing, and collaboration with the technology team  Educate as required  CISO or security leader  Assessment of the Information Risk & Security Program  Identify 5 major gaps or quick wins and close  Advanced threat detection capabilities on the network or the endpoint  2-factor authentication for remote access  Sufficient technical capabilities and visibility into the environment to determine if the organization may be compromised  If not, perform a technical assessment (e.g. Compromised Assessment) by a 3rd party  If so, perform a control / threat assessment by a 3rd party  Post 100 day Security Strategy / Roadmap  12-18-24 months
