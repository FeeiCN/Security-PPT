#RSAC
Motivation: Electronic Voting

#RSAC
Motivation: Electronic Voting
Traditional voting
To ensure voter's privacy: shake the ballot box
3

#RSAC
Motivation: Electronic Voting
Electronic version
To ensure voter's privacy: shuffle the ciphertexts
4

#RSAC
Motivation: Electronic Voting
The shuffle is done by a mix-server

Original
 = (1, 2, 3)

Permutation

 =

1 2

2 1

3 3

Shuffled
 = 1 , 2 , 3
 = ()  (1; )

Shuffled ciphertexts must be re-randomized to hide 

5

#RSAC
Motivation: Electronic Voting
Issues to address:
You don't trust the mix-server Mix-server must provide proof that shuffle is done correctly Proof can be verified by anyone, at any time
The mix-server doesn't trust you Proof must not reveal the permutation to any verifier

#RSAC
How to Prove? How to Verify a Proof?

#RSAC
Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proof

Prover

a = f(w) random challenge c

Verifier

z = f(a, c)

Input: Witness w

Output: Verify(a, c, z)

Complete: If Prover is honest, Verifier should always accept Sound: If Prover is not honest, Verifier should reject proof Zero-knowledge: Verifier does not learn anything about the permutation from valid proof

8

#RSAC
Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge

Prover CRS

Verifier

Input: Witness w

proof = f(w, CRS)

Output: Verify(proof, CRS)

Verifier's challenge c is incorporated into a (randomly generated) reference string This is called the common reference string (CRS) model

Alternative is the random oracle (RO) model (challenge c is replaced by a hash function)

Culpably sound: successful adversary + secret key can break security assumptions
Still acceptable, can assume some coalition of parties know secret key
White-box sound: successful adversary + random coins of all encrypters (e.g. voters) can break security assumptions
Weaker notion, can not only extract plaintexts, but also randomizers

NIZK Shuffle Argument: Overview
Common input:  = 1, 2, 3,  ,  : set of ciphertexts before shuffle  = 1 , 2 , 3 ,  ,  : set of ciphertexts after shuffle
Private input: permutation , or equivalently, permutation matrix P Main idea: 1. Prove that there exists a permutation matrix P such that P = ,
where  =   ,  =   2. Find verification equations that hold only for honestly generated , 
14

#RSAC
Building Blocks

Commit to -tuples using the polynomial commitment scheme [Gro10b, Lip12]

1, 2,  ,   

 =

1, 2

()  =0

commit

1, 2,  ,   1 О 2

Bilinear maps, : 1 О 2  T Elgamal encryption,  ;  = (,  )
15

#RSAC
Step 1: Permutation Matrix Argument

P is permutation matrix iff:
Every row (transposed) is a unit vector
Every column sums to 1
16

(0 0 1 0 0 0) (0 2 0 0 0 0) (0 0 0 1 0 0) ( 1 -1 0 0 0 0 ) (0 0 0 0 0 1) (0 0 0 0 1 0)
(0 0 1 0 0 0) (0 1 0 0 0 0) (0 0 0 1 0 0) (0 1 0 0 0 0) (0 0 0 0 0 1) (0 0 0 0 1 0)

#RSAC
Step 1: Permutation Matrix Argument
Permutation Matrix argument for P = P is as follows:
A. Commit to every row of  Choose randomness s.t. =1  = 0
B. For each committed row  and its commitment: Prove it is a valid commitment to a unit vector
C. It can trivially checked that =1 (; ) = (1; 0)
17

#RSAC
Step 1B: Unit Vector Argument

 is unit vector iff every element is Boolean and sum to 1. This holds iff V +   0,2 +1, i.e.

(V +  - 1+1)  (V +  - 1+1) = 1+1,

where V =

2О 1

,b=

0 1

Use square span programs (SSP), similar to [DFGK14]

18

#RSAC
Step 2: Finding the Equations

Assume  = (). Consider the tautology





 ( , 2  ) =  (, 2-1()  )

=1

=1

Need privacy: the term 2-1()  reveals -1 
Commit to P = P-1, replace term by  ;  2

Induces extra "error" term  = (, , )

19

#RSAC
Step 2: Finding the Equations
Not yet sound!
Adversary can create "valid" ,  but : ( )  (  ) Fix: add similar equations using different polynomials (  )=0
This is finally culpably sound under a new Power Simultaneous Product (PSP) assumption
We prove this assumption holds in the generic bilinear group model
20

#RSAC
Additional Notes

Permutation matrix must be committed w.r.t.both sets of polynomials () =0, (  )=0
Need to prove they commit to same value
() =0, (  )=0 must be carefully chosen so the conditions of the PSP assumption are true

Such a choice exists

Assumptions: XDH, PKE, PCDH, TSDH, PSP

Theorem (Informal)
If the above scheme is based on an EUF-CMA-secure signature scheme with forward-security, then it is secure according to the previous definition.
Proof Technique:
show that attacker must forge  1 signature if changing any information before last recent epoch switch copy that signature and output it as a forgery against the signature scheme = tight

"Audit data must be protected from modification and unauthorized destruction to permit detection and after-the-fact investigations of security violations." -- [Lat85]
"It is particularly important to ensure the integrity of audit trail data against modification. [...] The audit trail files needs to be protected since, for example, intruders may try to `cover their tracks' by modifying audit trail records. " -- [NIS95, Section 18.3.1]
"[A product] shall protect the stored audit records in the audit trail from unauthorised deletion. [A product] shall be able to prevent/detect unauthorised modifications to the stored audit records in the audit trail." -- [CC12, Section 8.6].

KeyGen(T ): Create a key pair (sk0, pk ), where sk0 is the initial secret key. (pk is constant for all epochs.) T is an upper bound on the number of epochs.
Update(ski ): Compute ski+1 from ski . (If i < T - 1. ski is expected to be erased securely.)
Sign(ski , m): Create a signature  for m with key ski . Verify(pk , i, m, ): Check if m was signed in epoch i.
1 is implicit.

Security Experiment

for a scheme FS, an attacker A, and T  poly()
Setup obtain (sk0, pk )  KeyGen(T ), give pk , T to A. Queries A interacts with the challenger:
may request signature  for arbitrary messages m may force the challenger to update the secret key may obtain one secret key ski
afterwards: no more queries allowed Forgery A outputs a message m, signature  and epoch
number i.

Security Definition

Definition (Trivial Forgeries)
A forgery is trivial iff: A requested a signature for m during epoch i or A obtained the secret key for an epoch i  i

Definition (Winning)
A wins an instance of the experiment if it outputs a valid and non-trivial forgery.

Definition (Security)
FS is secure if no PPT attacker A has non-negligible (in ) chance to win.

Logging Schemes with Excerpts

KeyGen(T ): creates key pair sk0, pk .
Update(ski , M, ): compute ski+1 from ski . (If i < T - 1. ski is expected to be erased securely.) M is the current overall logfile, and  is the corresponding signature for it.
AppendAndSign(ski , (m, N), M, ): Creates a signature for the message m, which is inserted into the categories N.
Extract(ski , M, , N): Creates a signature for the excerpt for categories N of M.
Verify(pk , N, E, ): Checks an excerpt E for completeness and correctness.

New Feature: Excerpts

Definition (Category)
Let M (the log file) be a sequence of log entries (mi , Ni ). The category named  is the subsequence C(, M) of M that contains all entries with   Ni .
Definition (Excerpt)
Let M (the log file) be a sequence of log entries. An excerpt for categories N = {1, . . . , n} is the subsequence
E = C(, M) ,
N
where C(, M) is the category named . (For a proper adaptation of  to sequences.)

Proving Security
Theorem (Informal)
If the above scheme is based on an EUF-CMA-secure signature scheme with forward-security, then it is secure according to the previous definition.
Proof Technique:
show that attacker must forge  1 signature if changing any information before last recent epoch switch copy that signature and output it as a forgery against the signature scheme = tight

Proof (Sketch)
Reduction:
assume successful attacker A against logging scheme construct attacker B against FS show that B has non-negligible success probability
Emulation of the Experiment:
B must emulate the logging security experiment for A. B plays the forward-secure unforgeability game against FS.

Case 1: i < iBreakIn epoch markers in excerpt E :
signature on (N, E ) valid for epoch i < iBreakIn. A never queried for a signature for E = B never queried for (N, E) (assuming proper encoding) = valid and non-trivial forgery on (N, E)
Case 2:  iBreakIn epoch markers in excerpt E :
 changed the excerpt wrt. a previous epoch i < iBreakIn restrict the discussion to epochs before break-in

Forgeries

Assume for contradiction:
All messages (including counters!) in forged excerpt were queried at signature oracle before.
Ensured by Verification:
no messages from other categories no duplicates message order = forged excerpt is subsequence of "real" excerpt. non-trivial = strict subsequence ( )
Verification checks for completeness = excerpt invalid = contradiction = A forged a signature
