Kill your data!
Abstracting toxic data into a token mitigates the risks associated with data privacy and residency issues. Tokenization is a type of data loss prevention. Tokenized systems are typically not in scope (e.g. PCI) Tokenization can be applied to any Toxic Data string (00110100101001001000111101010)
