#RSAC
Preparing for Cloud IR

Collect streaming events log data, API results

Collect batch data - log data, disk, memory images

Execute ad hoc collection via APIs - automated or
human mediated

Search and investigate the collections

Enrich data with third party information -
asset/identity, HR, threat intel

Automate collection/analysis/sharing
tasks

#RSAC
Operational Considerations for Collection

Logs
Streaming or batched
Structured or unstructured

Binary data
Memory dumps are unstructured
Disk forensics require storage

Analytics
Out of the box vs Custom
Collaboration requires
integration

Automation
Test and Rollback
Human mediation

Attack and IR Scenarios

#RSAC
Linkin' Joe: Insider File Sharing
Joe creates a shared link on a cloud storage folder and emails it to an accomplice. Over the course of a month, Joe posts company proprietary data to the folder. And over the course of the month, Joe's accomplice makes copies of the data.

#RSAC
IR: Linkin' Joe
Identity
 Log data: cloud storage, on-prem auth  Enrich with: DLP or watch listed files, HR watch list, local file access
Resources
 Search for unauthenticated access to a folder
Interactions
 Search for large number of files moving to a specific folder  Make a list of file names uploaded/downloaded to folder

#RSAC
Pickpocket: Compromised Cloud Keys
Stolen cloud infrastructure keys are used to instantiate new instances and access existing instances

IR: Pickpocket
Identity
 Identify the keys that were stolen  Enrich log data: threat intel, IP, domains, file names, service names
Resources
 Log data: cloud infrastructure, cloud instance, threat intel  Host data: memory dump, cloud instance snapshot  Search other cloud instances for discovered indicators
Interactions
 Search log data for: use of keys, number of instances, durations of sessions  Search memory: installed services, open ports, files names
Contain
 API: Disable keys  API: Modify security zones for instances spawned by infected key use

#RSAC
N'synch - synch folder propagator
Malware propagates by copying itself to auto synch folders for cloud storage service

#RSAC
N'synch IR
Identity
 Identify owner of infected file
Resources
 Cloud storage, email  Search storage logs for file operations
Interactions
 Search host logs for reg keys, services, files, sockets
Contain
 API: remove propagating file  API: change permissions on infected folders

#RSAC
Takeaways and Call to Action

#RSAC
Call to Action for Cloud IR

Collect Data from Anywhere

Search Based on New Criteria

Enrich from internal, external sources on demand

Automation, Workflows, Sharing
Demand APIs from Security Vendors
