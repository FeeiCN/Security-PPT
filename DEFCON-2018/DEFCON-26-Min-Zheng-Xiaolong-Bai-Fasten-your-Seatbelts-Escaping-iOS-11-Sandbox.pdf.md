Sandbox

 Apple`s Sandbox was introduced as "SeatBelt" in MacOS 10.5 which provides the first full fledged implementation of a MACF policy.

 From its inception, the policy hooked dozens of operations. The number of hooks has been growing steadily when new system calls or newly discovered threats appeared (tables from *OS internals):

Version 34 120 211/220 300 358 459 592 763

XNU 1510 1699 2107 2422 2782 3216 3789 4570

System Version macOS 10.6 macOS 10.7 iOS 6/macOS 10.8 iOS 7/macOS 10.9 iOS 8/macOS 10.10 iOS 9/macOS 10.11 iOS 10/macOS 10.12 iOS 11/macOS 10.13

Sandbox Profiles
 In MacOS, profiles are visible and stored in /System/Library/Sandbox/Profiles. In iOS, the profiles were hard-compiled into /usr/libexec/sandboxd. It's hard to decode the sandbox profiles, but we can traverse all mach services to get the mach-lookup list according to the return value (e.g., through sbtool by Jonathan Levin).
Alibaba Security

Mach Service Name -> Binary
 In order to find vulnerabilities, we need to disassemble and analyze the binaries which contain the handler functions of related mach services. /System/Library/LaunchDaemons contains the configuration plist of most mach services. In the plist files, "ProgramArguments" shows the path of the binary and "MachServices"shows the related mach services.
Alibaba Security

Mach, XPC and NSXPC
 Mach messages contain typed data, which can include port rights and references to large regions of memory. XPC msg is built on top of Mach msg and NSXPC msg is built on top of XPC msg.
 Through Mach msg, sandboxed app can communicate with unsandboxed Mach (MIG) services, XPC services and NSXPC services.

XPC: Arbitrary File Move CVE-2015-7037
 com.apple.PersistentURLTranslator.Gatekeeper /System/Library/Frameworks/AssetsLibrary.framework/Support/assetsd
 This service has path traversal vulnerability that an app can mv folders outside the sandbox with mobile privilege (used in Pangu9 for jailbreak).

NSXPC: Arbitrary SQLite File Query Outside the Sandbox
 com.apple.medialibraryd.xpc (/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/MusicLibrary.framework/Support/medialibra ryd)
POC:
 The sandboxed app can use [[connection remoteObjectProxy] beginTransactionForDatabaseAtPath] method to connect arbitrary SQLite files on the system and then use [[connection remoteObjectProxy] executeQuery] to execute SQL commands.

Mach Service: Bluetoothd
 There are 132 functions (start from 0xFA300) in the "com.apple.server.bluetooth" Mach service of bluetoothd.

 Bluetoothd communicate with sandboxed apps and other unsandboxed processes (e.g., SpringBoard) through "com.apple.server.Bluetooth".

Mach Service: Bluetoothd
 A process can use BTSessionAttach to create a session_token for bluetoothd and then use BTLocalDeviceAddCallbacks to register a callback for event notification.

0xFA300 BTSessionAttach

0xFA303 BTLocalDeviceAddCallbacks with ses_token_2 and callback2 addr
invoke callback2

Alibaba Security

Mach Service: Bluetoothd CVE-2018-4087 by @raniXCH
 However, Bluetoothd only uses the session token to identify the process which means we can use a sandboxed app to hijack a communication between bluetoothd and unsandboxed processes through the session token.

Alibaba Security

Mach Service: Bluetoothd CVE-2018-4087
 The problem is the ses_token is too easy to be brute forced. It only has 0x10000 (0x0000 - 0xFFFF) possible values.

 Apple fixed this problem by adding a user_id (=arc4random()) to each session, only the process knows the user_id and bluetoothd will check the map[ses_token] == user_id.

Bluetoothd

SpringBoard

0xFA300 BTSessionAttach with user_id
ses_token_1
0xFA303 BTLocalDeviceAddCallbacks with ses_token_1 , user_id and callback1 addr
invoke callback1

User_id?

Alibaba Security

Mach Service: Bluetoothd 0-day bugs
 As we mentioned before, a user_id = arc4random() = [0x00000000-0xFFFFFFFF]. If we know the session_token, we can still hijack the communication through the user_id brute force.

 But it takes a very long long time (about 12 hours) ...  Wait...what if there are other callback registration functions without a user_id?

 Bingo! 0xFA365 BTAccessoryManagerAddCallbacks()!

Alibaba Security

Mach Service: Bluetoothd 0-day bugs
 However, after sending message to bluetoothd through BTAccessoryManagerAddCallbacks(), nothing happened!
 Finally, I found the problem. The callback event can be triggered only when the iOS device connects to a new device which means we need to trigger the callback by click the Bluetooth device manually.
Click!
Alibaba Security

Mach Service: Bluetoothd 0-day bugs
 CallBacks 1(a long long time), CallBacks 2(hard to trigger), CallBacks 3 Again! Yes, we found a new function with callbacks and it's easy to trigger!
 0xFA329 BTDiscoveryAgentCreate() can create a callback for the discovery agent and then we can use 0xFA32B BTDiscoveryAgentStartScan() to trigger the callback without manual click!

PC Control -> Control the Process in a Classic Way
 The goal is not only control the PC pointer but the process as well.

 Next step is to create a ROP chain and do a heap spray for the target process.

 In this case, we use

ROP ROP ROP ROP

ROP ROP ROP ROP

PC

ROP ROP ROP ROP

MACH_MSGH_BITS_COMPLEX Mach msg with MACH_MSG_OOL_DESCRIPTOR memory.

ROP ROP ROP

ROP ROP ROP

ROP ROP ROP

ROP ROP ROP

 If we send the msg and don't receive the msg, the ROP chain will stay in the target's memory space persistently.

Memory

 After several tests, we can find a MAGIC_ADDR which is 0x105400000.

PC Control -> Control the Process in a Classic Way
 Controlled registers: X3,X4,X5,X19,X20. And last BR is X4:
Stack pivot ?
 Until now, we can only do BOP (JOP). But it's hard for us to control the program flow. So, we need a stack pivot to control the stack and change BOP -> ROP.
Alibaba Security

PC Control -> Control the Process in a Classic Way
 A great stack pivot gadget can be found at libsystem_platform.dylib: Control X0 -> x19 & x20

 If we can control x0, then we can control sp.

Control X0 -> x2 & x29 Control X2 -> SP RET!
Alibaba Security

PC Control -> Control the Process in an Elegant Way
 Now we can ROP (e.g., steal files, open a sandboxed IOKit userclient)!
Task port?
 But ROP is not elegant. We want the task port to control everything!
Alibaba Security

Mach Port 101
 A port provides an endpoint for IPC. Messages can be sent to a port or received from it:
 Ports can contain rights and port rights can be passed in messages.  The most important port for one process is mach_task_self(). One can control the
memory and all registers of the process through its task port.
Alibaba Security

Mach Port 101
task_port

 We can use mach_vm_allocate(target_task_port, &remote_addr, remote_size, 1) to allocate memory in a remote process.

mach_msg

 mach_vm_write(target_task_port, remote_address, local_address, length) can be used to copy data into a remote process.

process

 thread_create_running(target_task_port, ARM_THREAD_STATE64, &thread_state, stateCnt, &thread_port) can be use to create a new thread in a remote process.
 Therefore, if we can get one process's task port. We can easily control the whole process through mach msg.
Alibaba Security

Get the task port!
 Let's try to get the task port of the remote process.

Pwn app

BTd port

Launchd

Bluetoothd

Send 0x1000 ports with pwn apps's send right Send ROP through heap spray
Use vulnerability to control the pc of BTd Use ROP to send mach msgs contain mach_task_self()
Control the target process through its task port

Alibaba Security

Get the task port!
Some tricks learn from Mach_portal:
 We can use mach_port_insert_right(mach_task_self(), port, port, MACH_MSG_TYPE_MAKE_SEND) to insert a send right to the port. And this port can be send by OOL message with MACH_MSG_PORT_DESCRIPTOR type.
 In most time, mach_task_self() returns 0x103, so we can just use 0x103 without ROP (to call mach_task_self()).
 In order to send the task port to our pwn app, we need to know the port number of our pwn app. But we cannot use launchd to help us. Luckily, the port number can be guessed by (0x103+0x100*N). That's why we send 0x1000 ports to the remote process (in order to increase the successful rate).

iOS 11 mitigation

Conclusion
 We introduce the basic conception of iOS sandbox and summarize several classic ways to escape the iOS sandbox.
 Based on an old bluetoothd vulnerability, we find two new zero-day sandbox escape vulnerabilities on the latest iOS version.
 We present a classic way to do heap spray , stack pivot and ROP in the iOS userland.
 We show how to get and control the task port of the remote process during the exploit.
