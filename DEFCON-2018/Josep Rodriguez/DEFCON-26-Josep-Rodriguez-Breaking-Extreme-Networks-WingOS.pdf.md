Intro to WingOS
 Embedded Linux OS with proprietary modifications in Kernel.  Created by Motorola. Now property of Extreme networks.  Architecture Mips N32.  Used mainly in Wireless AP and Controllers.  No public information or previous research about its internals.

Attack Surface & Scenarios
1. Aircraft Scenario:
Focused in the remote pre-auth vulnerabilities found.  Ethernet cable: - Less likely in an Aircraft. - UDP Services/ Mint Services.  Wi-Fi ( open Wi-Fi or password protected Wi-Fi)  Pivoting from Sat modem to AP (From the ground!)

Attack Surface & Scenarios
IOActive, Inc. Copyright 2018. All Rights Reserved.

Attack Surface & Scenarios
2. Other scenarios:
Focused in the remote pre-auth vulnerabilities found.  Connect Ethernet cable directly: - More likely with outdoor Access Points but also
possible inside buildings.  Wi-Fi ( open Wi-Fi or password protected Wi-Fi).  Internal network (you are inside the network).

Vulnerabilities
Hidden root shell backdoor.
 From restricted CLI to hidden root shell.  Attacker perspective. CLI access: Good, Root shell: completely compromised  Not critical vuln but very important for the research process.
IOActive, Inc. Copyright 2018. All Rights Reserved.

Hidden root shell backdoor.
IOActive, Inc. Copyright 2018. All Rights Reserved.

Hidden root shell backdoor.
IOActive, Inc. Copyright 2018. All Rights Reserved.

Hidden root shell backdoor.

IOActive, Inc. Copyright 2018. All Rights Reserved.

Default value in every WingOS

Hidden root shell backdoor.
The content of the file is passed to the Following loop. Let's emulate this loop with Unicorn. Unicorn uses Qemu in the background and allows You to emulate assembly code for several archs.
IOActive, Inc. Copyright 2018. All Rights Reserved.

Hidden root shell backdoor.
IOActive, Inc. Copyright 2018. All Rights Reserved.

Hidden root shell backdoor.
Basically, the content of the file are hex bytes (in ascii).
IOActive, Inc. Copyright 2018. All Rights Reserved.

Hidden root shell backdoor.
Decrypts (RC4) the contents of the file (as hex bytes) with the key "Hi Sabeena? How're you doin'? Bye!!" In this case, the decryption result of the file is the string "password".
IOActive, Inc. Copyright 2018. All Rights Reserved.

Hidden root shell backdoor.
Get the MAC addr of the device And does the following operation with MAC: XX:XX+1:XX+2:XX+3:XX+4:XX+5
IOActive, Inc. Copyright 2018. All Rights Reserved.

Hidden root shell backdoor.
RC4 decrypt "password" with the key XX:XX+1:XX+2:XX+3:XX+4:XX+5
IOActive, Inc. Copyright 2018. All Rights Reserved.

Hidden root shell backdoor.
This last block will make sure that the valid password calculated, will contain only lower-case letters.
IOActive, Inc. Copyright 2018. All Rights Reserved.

Hidden root shell backdoor.
If password granted:
Different password next time you try to get shell.

Remote pre-auth stack overflow.

IOActive, Inc. Copyright 2018. All Rights Reserved.

UDP service listening on 0.0.0.0 by default.
RIM process (Radio Interface Module)

Remote pre-auth stack overflow.
IOActive, Inc. Copyright 2018. All Rights Reserved.

Remote pre-auth stack overflow.
IOActive, Inc. Copyright 2018. All Rights Reserved.

Remote pre-auth stack overflow.
 Only some old versions vulnerable to this stack overflow(Let's see why in a minute).
 Kontron devices (aircrafts) firmware should be vulnerable based on info in their website.
IOActive, Inc. Copyright 2018. All Rights Reserved.

Remote pre-auth "global" denial of service.
Newest firmware version, stack overflow fixed. But...
IOActive, Inc. Copyright 2018. All Rights Reserved.

Remote pre-auth "global" denial of service.
IOActive, Inc. Copyright 2018. All Rights Reserved.

Remote pre-auth "global" denial of service.
Watchdog checks if RIM process is running, if not, the whole OS is rebooted. Execute the same POC 2 o 3 times killing the RIM process several times and the whole OS will be rebooted.

Mint Vulnerabilities

Lots of recvfrom in binaries. Domain 0x32? Local_mint_addr?

IOActive, Inc. Copyright 2018. All Rights Reserved.

What is Mint?
No much info on the internet. L2/L3 proprietary protocol Level 1 VLAN Level 2 IP
IOActive, Inc. Copyright 2018. All Rights Reserved.

Mint
L2/L3 proprietary protocol
Proprietary socket address family (AF_MINT) (sys/socket.c sys/socket.h) Datagram socket 1. Reverse engineer their kernel to mimic this L2/L3 protocol and build a client 2. Try to emulate the whole OS/Kernel (Probable, but might be painful) 3. Find a way to build a client using their OS kernel.
IOActive, Inc. Copyright 2018. All Rights Reserved.

Mint
Attack scenarios using Mint:
 Attacker connects its device to the network or directly to the target Device (Wireless or Cable)
 Attacker remotely compromises a device connected to the network.
 Attack services/AP/Controllers over Mint services.
 Controllers == Windows DC
IOActive, Inc. Copyright 2018. All Rights Reserved.

Creating Mint Client:
Mint client: Inspecting their library usr/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload/_socket.so :
We should be able to import socket and create Mint sockets.
IOActive, Inc. Copyright 2018. All Rights Reserved.

Mint
Default config of controller Standalone AP can also be configured as Controller
IOActive, Inc. Copyright 2018. All Rights Reserved.

Mint
Attacker's device. I want to connect over mint to the Controller(victim). Now, Controller (victim) sees attacker over mint. And attacker can also connecter over mint to Controller (victim).
IOActive, Inc. Copyright 2018. All Rights Reserved.

Mint Vulnerabilities
Services listening on several ports over L2/L3 protocol Example of function parsing messages over 1 specific port (HSD process):
IOActive, Inc. Copyright 2018. All Rights Reserved.

Vulnerability
Memcpy's src and len user-controlled, dst is heap. Totally controllable: HSD process, Mint port 14
IOActive, Inc. Copyright 2018. All Rights Reserved.

Vulnerability
To reach that memcpy in the switch case statement we have to: First go to case0 of switch statement and we got a restriction. Get_session_by_mac check if the MAC sent in our payload is authenticated.
IOActive, Inc. Copyright 2018. All Rights Reserved.

Vulnerability
To reach that memcpy in the switch case statement we have to: Luckily we can add a fake MAC to the authenticated list Another case for the switch case statement allow us that:
IOActive, Inc. Copyright 2018. All Rights Reserved.

Vulnerability
To reach that memcpy in the switch case statement we have to send this: First, session alloc for our Fake MAC addr
IOActive, Inc. Copyright 2018. All Rights Reserved.

Vulnerability
To reach that memcpy in the switch case statement we have to send this: And now we can reach the vulnerable memcpy

Vulnerability
Stack overflow where user data comes from the previous memcpy vuln. To overflow the Stack the Heap buffer has to be overflowed as well:

Vulnerability
IOActive, Inc. Copyright 2018. All Rights Reserved.

Vulnerability
LIBC sanity checks can make it crash before the stack overflow happens. We could try to provide valid data in the next chunk's metadata to avoid crash (NO ASLR) In this case is not necessary as it won't crash if we execute the exploit "quick". Provide valid data in the next chunk's metadata to make it more reliable.
IOActive, Inc. Copyright 2018. All Rights Reserved.

EXPLOIT
 NO ASLR, NO NX, NO STACK CANARIES..  Just jump to our shellcode? Nope.  Cache incoherence problem (well known):  MIPS CPU I-Cache D-Cache Instructions, Data.  Our payload likely will be stored in the D-Cache.

 FILL THE D-CACHE TO FLUSH IT (Depends on how big it is)  Call a blocking function such as Sleep( ) using ROP  The cache will be flushed.

ROP: From the epilogue we know the registers that we control at the crash time.
