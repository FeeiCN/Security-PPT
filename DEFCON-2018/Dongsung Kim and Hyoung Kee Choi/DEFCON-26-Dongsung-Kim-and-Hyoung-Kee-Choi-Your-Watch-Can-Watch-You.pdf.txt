u Services
 Special privileged daemons dedicated for a resource
 e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, messaging, sensors, ...
 Must reject requests from unauthorized parties

u Service must check if calling app has access
 App must acquire the "privilege" in prior
u App dev specifies privileges in tizen-manifest.xml
 User accepts the permission for the app  Installer checks and registers the privilege policy  Accesses are controlled at the runtime
u Tizen defines many privileges
 internet, bluetooth, network.set, screenshot, notification, email, ...
 Only some of them are "Public"
 Allowed to be used by most developers

u DAC (Discretionary Access Control)
 Classic UNIX user ID + group ID policies
u SMACK (Simplified Mandatory Access Control in Kernel)
 Kernel-space isolation  App receives a unique label at install time
 e.g., User::Pkg::sample_app
 For every kernel object access, the current context (label) is checked against the SMACK rules

u Cynara
 User-space privilege management daemon  Used by services to check
the calling application's privilege  Identifies an application with its SMACK label  Checks the label against Cynara database
u Security Manager
 Security policy configurator daemon
 At install time, launch time, and runtime
 Populates DAC policies, SMACK labels, and Cynara database from different sources
 e.g., default filesystem, manifest files, ...

u IPC (Inter-Process Communication) system
 For Linux-like OSes, integrated with systemd  High-level messages, useful built-in functions
 e.g., discoverability, introspection, ...
 Service daemon registers to D-Bus daemon, clients request resources via messages
 Tizen heavily relies on D-Bus*
u Concepts
 Service (Bus name, Destination)  Client (Application, Source)  Object, Interface, Method, Property

org.example.interface method SetFoo(int32): void
method GetFoo(): int32
Client Process

Service Process
/org/example/object3 /org/example/object2 /org/example/object1 SetFoo(int32)
