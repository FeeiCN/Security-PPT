ARIN Policy 4.10: Dedicated IPv4 block to facilitate IPv6 Deployment
When ARIN receives its last /8 IPv4 allocation from IANA, a contiguous /10 IPv4 block will be set aside and dedicated to facilitate IPv6 deployment. Allocations and assignments from this block must be justified by immediate IPv6 deployment requirements. Examples of such needs include: IPv4 addresses for key dual stack DNS servers, and NAT-PT or NAT464 translators. ARIN staff will use their discretion when evaluating justifications.
This block will be subject to a minimum size allocation of /28 and a maximum size allocation of /24. ARIN should use sparse allocation when possible within that /10 block.
In order to receive an allocation or assignment under this policy:
1. the applicant may not have received resources under this policy in the preceding six months; 2. previous allocations/assignments under this policy must continue to meet the justification requirements of this policy; 3. previous allocations/assignments under this policy must meet the utilization requirements of end user assignments; 4. the applicant must demonstrate that no other allocations or assignments will meet this need; 5. on subsequent allocation under this policy, ARIN staff may require applicants to renumber out of previously allocated /
assigned space under this policy in order to minimize non-contiguous allocations.
