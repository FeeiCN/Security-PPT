 Smartcards control authentication!  Authentication runs as root!  Users and programmers
subconsciously trust the smartcard!

What is a Smartcard?

 Physical, tamper-proof device  Designed to keep information secret  Contains memory and a processor

PKCS11

 PKCS11 is a platform independent API for cryptographic token
 Supported by OpenSSL, browsers,... (eg. via libp11)
 Windows uses smartcard Minidriver now
 Driver for each card, uses ATR to match

Challenges in fuzzing a protocol
 Most modern fuzzers are file-oriented  Radamsa: Generates a corpus of files  Hongfuzz: passes a file (filename different each run)  libfuzzer: passes a buffer and length  AFL: passes a file

Challenges in fuzzing a protocol

 SCardTransmit() tells us how much data it expects  Read this from a file on each call and error out if EOF  No complicated poll handling like for network sockets required

Roadblocks

 Channel back to card is quite limited  Might need to use revocation list check for information leaks  Interaction during exploitation not possible with basiccard, get SIMtrace for
that  But: A single bitflip from false to true during login can be enough :)

Takeaways / Conclusions

 Think about trust models!  Some security measures increase your attack surface big time!  Fuzz Everything!  Limit attack surface by disabling certain drivers.  Do not write drivers in C ;-)
