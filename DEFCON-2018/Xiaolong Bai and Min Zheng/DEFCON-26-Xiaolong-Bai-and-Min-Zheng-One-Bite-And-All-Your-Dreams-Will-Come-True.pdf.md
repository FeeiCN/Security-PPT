Overview
4

Every driver is a kernel extension (.kext) sharing the same space with the kernel
 Location of driver binaries:

 On macOS: /System/Library/Extensions
  On iOS: integrated with kernel in kernelcache
5

Userclient: kernel objects for drivers to provide service to programs in userspace
 Userclient is the interface between user-space applications and devices
6

In order to provide services, userclients need to implement several callback methods:

 externalMethod: Provide methods that can be called in user-
space

 clientMemoryForType: Share memory with apps in user-
space

 registerNotificationPort: Allow user-space app to register for
notifications

 clientClose: Close connection with user-space app
 ...
7

externalMethod(uint32_t selector,  IOExternalMethodArguments *arguments,  IOExternalMethodDispatch *dispatch,  OSObject *target, void *reference);

 Callback to provide methods to userspace program
  selector: to select method in userclient
  arguments: arguments passed to the selected method
  dispatch: a struct representing the method to be called
  target: the target userclient for the method to be called on
  reference: reference to send results back to userspace program
8

Despite of strict sandbox restriction, some userclients are still be accessible to sandboxed apps on iOS:

 IOHIDLibUserClient
  IOMobileFramebufferUserClient
  IOSurfaceAcceleratorClient
  AppleJPEGDriverUserClient
  IOAccelDevice2, IOAccelSharedUserClient2,
IOAccelCommandQueue2

 AppleKeyStoreUserClient
  IOSurfaceSendRight, IOSurfaceRootUserClient

New vulns in Apple drivers
10

Drivers are good targets for exploiting the kernel

 Share the same space with the kernel
  Have kernel privileges
  Some programmed by third-party vendors, not kernel
developer

 Code quality is not guaranteed

Drivers are frequently exploited in attacks against the kernel, including jailbreaks
11

Previous vulns in drivers used in jailbreaks:

 11 (v0rtex/electra): IOSurfaceRoot (CVE-2017-13861)
  9 (pangu): IOMobileFrameBuffer (CVE-2016-4654)
  8 (TaiG): IOHIDFamily (CVE-2015-5774)
  7 (pangu): AppleKeyStore (CVE-2014-4407) 

Next, let's have a look at some new vulns we recently discovered in Apple drivers!
12

Privilege escalation on macOS 10.13.3
13

This privilege escalation leverages a new Use-AfterFree vulnerability in the driver IOAcceleratorFamily2

 IOAccelDisplayPipeUserClient2::s_transaction_end
All IOAccelDisplayPipeUserClient2  share the same IOAccelDisplayPipe2
14

This privilege escalation leverages a new Use-AfterFree vulnerability in the driver IOAcceleratorFamily2

 IOAccelDisplayPipe2::transaction_end
IOAccelDisplayPipe2 contains a link list of IOAccelDisplayPipe2Transaction2. IOAccelDisplayPipe2::transaction_end traverse the link list to find a transaction
A link list of transactions in this IOAccelDisplayPipe2
And further call IOAccelDisplayPipeTransaction2::set_transaction_args using the found transaction
15

This privilege escalation leverages a new Use-AfterFree vulnerability in the driver IOAcceleratorFamily2

 IOAccelDisplayPipeTransaction2::set_transaction_args
mAccelDisplayPipeUserClient2 is a member of IOAccelDisplayPipeTransaction2,  whose type is IOAccelDisplayPipeUserClient2, 
representing which userclient the transaction belongs to The userclient that this transaction belongs to
16

This privilege escalation leverages a new Use-AfterFree vulnerability in the driver IOAcceleratorFamily2

 But, mAccelDisplayPipeUserClient2 can be released by
calling IOServiceClose from user space, causing useafter-free
Userclient can be released from user space
Cause use-after-freee
17

Exploitation of the bug

 Creat 2 IOAccelDisplayPipeUserClient2
  Begin a IOAccelDisplayPipeTransaction2 by userclient1
  Release userclient1
  End the transaction from userclient2 --> use-after-free

The bug is not exploitable now! 

 Reason: different IOAccelDisplayPipeUserClient2 do not
share the same IOAccelDisplayPipe2 now !
18

Besides the above vuln, we also discovered some other new vulns in Apple drivers

 CVE-2017-7119 
  CVE-2018-4135 

Next, we will show details of these vulns

19

22

CVE-2017-7119

 Recall in IOFireWireUserClient::externalMethod
  outHandle is unintialized and returned to userspace
  Information leak!
23

CVE-2017-7119

 Can be exploited to get kernel slide, defeat kaslr, e.g.
Kernel slide = 0x4ebc0b6-0x8bc0b6 = 0x4600000 Though outChannelHandle is only 32bit, but enough since the high 32bit is always 0xffffff80 here
24

CVE-2018-4135

  Lack of locking or serialization when using and
releasing a member variable

 In IOFWUserReadCommand::submit
28

CVE-2018-4135 

 (a) release fMem, (b) uses fMem (fMem is a member)
29

CVE-2018-4135
 Exploit:

Obstacles in analyzing Apple drivers
39

Analyzing macOS and iOS kernel drivers is not easy!

 Drivers are closed-source: binaries are lack of high-level
semantics and variable types are lost

 Drivers are programmed in C++: virtual functions are
widely used but object types are unknown --> the real function called is unknown

 Symbols are lost in iOS drivers: iOS kernelcache strips
all symbols in drivers

40

What does a driver's binary look like in IDA pro?

 macOS driver: some symbols are kept

41

What does a driver's binary look like in IDA pro?

 macOS driver: But! Wrong parameter inference, lack of
variable types, unrecognizable virtual function calls

Wrong parameter inference Variable types are lost
Virtual function calls are unrecognizable
42

What does a driver's binary look like in IDA pro?

 iOS driver: symbols are totally lost

43

What does a driver's binary look like in IDA pro?

 iOS driver: data structure is gone, e.g. this figure should
be the location of a virtual table

44

What does a driver's binary look like in IDA pro?

 iOS driver: meaningless function names, totally lost
variable types, unrecognized virtual function calls 

Wronegvdeerycwomhepriele! result
45

What exactly do we want for a binary to be?

 Function (including virtual func) calls are recognizable,
the called functions are known

 Missing symbols are recovered, decompiled code is
understandable... 

Why?

 Knowing the real call target is a prerequisite for inter-
procedure analysis and futher analysis

 Manual review needs meaningful decompiled code
46

What exactly do we want for a binary to be?

 Just like we have the source code

47

Ryuk: a new static analysis tool  to analyze Apple drivers
48

Ryuk: a new static analysis tool aiming at solving uncertainties in Apple drivers, for further analyzing drivers' security

 Implemented as an IDA pro python script 

*Ryuk: a character in the comics series Death Note, who loves eating apples.
49

Ryuk's features (functionalities):

 Class recognition: identify classes' information
  VTable recognition: identify classes' virtual functions
  Recover function names: only for iOS drivers
  Resolve variable types: resolve and mark variable types
  Add cross references: for members and virtual funcs
  UI support: better UI support for manual review
  Call graph generation: for inter-procedure analysis
50

Class recognition

 Purpose: for variable type inference and further analysis
  Method: depend on RTTI information left in binaries
  Apple drivers are programed in C++ and support a
limited RTTI feature

 __mod_init_func: a section containing initialization
functions to support RTTI

 Analyzing functions in __mod_init_func section, we can
get information of classes (name, size...)
51

Class recognition

 __mod_init_func
macOS
iOS
52

Class recognition

 Functions in __mod_init_func: register class information
macOS
Class Name Class Size iOS
53

Class recognition

 Decompiled code of functions in __mod_init_func
macOS
iOS
54

Class recognition

 With identified class names and sizes, we can create
structures to represent these classes in IDA pro
55

VTable recognition

 In C++, virtual functions of a class are organized in a
structure called VTable, which is in __const section 

 In every C++ class, the first member is always a pointer
to this VTable.

VTable

Source code

Decompiled  code

56

VTable recognition

 Purpose: resolve the real targets of virtual function calls
  Method: on macOS, there are symbols for VTables

Symbols of VTables

VTable structure
57

VTable recognition


 Method: on iOS, several steps depending on the
vtable's specific structure


 Hint: find class's global metaclass object and further

find VTable

Class's global metaclass object

VTable start
58

VTable recognition

 iOS Step 1: adjust __const section in IDA pro

 In __const, mark each 8 bytes as a pointer
59

VTable recognition

 iOS Step 2: find address of class's global metaclass
object in initialization function of __mod_init_func 

 In Apple driver, most C++ classes have a global metaclass
object describing the class's basic information
Address of class's global metaclass object
Initialization function of __mod_init_func
60

VTable recognition

 iOS Step 3: check cross references of the global
metaclass object, find the one in const section and near the VTable
In const section  and near VTable
61

VTable recognition

 iOS Step 4: found VTable

The address of global metalcass object VTable start found!

62

VTable recognition

 After recognition, create structure in IDA pro standing
for the VTable, each member is pointer to a virtual func

 Set the first member of class structure as a pointer to
this VTable structure

VTable structure

63

Class structure

Recover function names (only for iOS)

 In drivers, most classes inherit from classes in the
kernel, e.g., IOService, OSObject

 Most classes in the kernel still keep symbols 
  In C++, when a child class inherits from a parent class
and overrides a virtual function, the overriden function has same name and offset in VTable

class A { public: virtual void foo();
}

class B: public A { public: virtual void foo();
}

... A::foo
...
A's VTable
64

Same name Same offset
in VTable

... B::foo
...
B's VTable

Recover function names (only for iOS)

 Only recover the overridden virtual functions in classes
inherited from classes in the kernel

 Not a complete solution, but cover plenty of critical
functions
IOSurfaceRoot:: IOSurfaceRoot

overriden functions

IOSurfaceRoot:: getMetaClass

IOSurfaceRoot's VTable (IOSurfaceRoot is inherited from IOSerivce)

IOSurfaceRoot:: free
65

IOService' VTable

Recover function names (only for iOS)

 Many function names can be recovered in this way

66

Now

Resolve variable types (in IDA pro's decompiled code)

 For local, global and member variables
  Method: identify variable types and perform type
propagation 

 How to identify variable types: two ways

 1. Depend on features of function names in C++
  2. Figure out the creation and iniatialization of variables
67

Resolve variable types (in IDA pro's decompiled code)

 Identify variable types method 1:

 After compilation, names of functions in C++ classes will
be encoded with the function name and argument types

 Decode (demangle) the C++ function names to get the type
of function arguments, e.g.

__ZN23IOSurfaceRootUserClient4initEP13IOSurfaceRootP4taskP12OSDictionary
Decode (Demangle)
IOSurfaceRootUserClient::init (IOSurfaceRoot *, task *, OSDictionary *)

68

Variable Types

Resolve variable types (in IDA pro's decompiled code)

 Identify variable types method 2:

 Figure out the creation and iniatialization of variables
  Find invocation of variable allocation, initialization and type
casting functions, e.g.

Allocation Func: OSMetaClass::allocClassWithName (const char *name)


Allocatoin Func: IOSurfaceRootUserClient::MetaClass::alloc ( )


Init Func:

IOCommandGate::IOCommandGate (IOCommandGate *)


Type Cast:

OSMetaClassBase::safeMetaCast (OSMetaClassBase *, OSMetaClass *)

69

Resolve variable types (in IDA pro's decompiled code)

 After identifying variable types, we can perform type
propagation along function's control flow
Type of v2 is IOAccelShared2 *
Type of v2 is IOGraphicsAccelerator2 *
70

Resolve variable types (in IDA pro's decompiled code)

 After identifying variable types, we can perform type
propagation along function's control flow
Propagate v2's type and affect the return type of function
Propagate v2's type and modify member variable's type
71

Add cross references:

 Purpose: add cross references for member varaibles
and virtual functions

 Method: examine every sentence in the decompiled
code of all functions, check whether member variable or virtual function is used, e.g.
72

Add cross references:

 References are added from the usage to members in
the class structures and to virtual function's implementation
73

Now, driver's decompiled code in IDA pro looks like

 Looks more like source code, right?
74

But, for manual review in IDA pro's decompiled code, though virtual function calls are recognized and identified with the help of above features, researchers still need more manual operation to examine the function's implementation. e.g.
Manual operation:

Step 1: Copy name of the called function
75

Step 2: Search the function name

UI support 

 Extend UI operation that can be performed in IDA pro's
decompiled code

 Method:

 Register action to double-click events
  Register action to key events
  Register action to name change events
  Register action to type change events
76

UI support 

 Extend UI operation that can be performed in IDA pro's
decompiled code, e.g. jump to virtual function's implementation by just a double click

 Method:

 Register action to double-click events
  Register action to key events
  Register action to name change events
  Register action to type change events
77

UI support
78

Generate call graph

 For further inter-procedure analysis, call graph is the
prerequisite 

 After variable types are resolved, targets of virtual
function calls can be recognized

 Then we can build call graph for all functions
79

Now, everything is ready, you can do your own manual analysis and static analysis
80

Ryuk-Fuzz: combine fuzzing  with static analysis
81

One use case of Ryuk: Ryuk-Fuzz

 Idea: Guide fuzzing of drivers with Ryuk's static analysis 
  Implementation: Integrate Ryuk with the state-of-art
Apple kernel driver fuzzer, PassiveFuzzFrameworkOSX 

 Method: 

 Step 1: Perform data flow analysis in Ryuk to infer drivers'
required user input formats

 Step 2: During fuzzing, use the inferred input formats to
guide input generation and improve fuzzing efficiency
82

Ryuk-Fuzz Step 1: Static data flow analysis to infer user input formats
Offset:0 Size: whole
Offset:24 Size: 1 Offset:0 Size: 4
Offset:68 Size: 4
83

Ryuk-Fuzz Step 1: Static data flow analysis to infer user input formats
Condition: offset 24, size: 1 should not be equal to 6 or 1
Condition: offset 0, size: 4 last 4 bits should not be equal to 0
84

Ryuk-Fuzz Step 2: Guide fuzzing

 BUT ! PassiveFuzzFrameworkOSX has implementation
errors

 Error 1: Wrong buffer size for reading the kernel header
(affect macOS 10.12 and later)

Error in PassiveFuzzFrameworkOSX
85

Ryuk-Fuzz Step 2: Guide fuzzing

 Error 1: Wrong buffer size for reading the kernel header
(affect macOS 10.12 and later)

PassiveFuzzFrameworkOSX assumes  kernel header is smaller than a page
86

Ryuk-Fuzz Step 2: Guide fuzzing

 Cause of Error 1: Wrong buffer size for reading the
kernel header (affect macOS 10.12 and later)

Before 10.12 Header size is  smaller than 1 page
After 10.12 Header size is  larger than 1 page
87

Ryuk-Fuzz Step 2: Guide fuzzing

 Solution to Error 1: enlarge the allocation size

2 * PAGE_SIZE_64
88

Ryuk-Fuzz Step 2: Guide fuzzing

 Error still exists in PassiveFuzzFrameworkOSX
  Error 2: Wrong way to infer kernel base at runtime 
(affect 10.13.2 and after) 

PassiveFuzzFrameworkOSX calcuate the address of interrupt handler  and search backwards for mach-o header ( i.e. the kernel base address )
89

Ryuk-Fuzz Step 2: Guide fuzzing

 Cause of Error 2: In current macOS, interrupt handler is
not in kernel text section now. As a result, we can not find the kernel base by searching backwards from the interrupt handler 


Before macOS 10.13.2 Kernel text start
(kernel base)
Address of  interrupt handler

After macOS 10.13.2

Address of  interrupt handler
Kernel text start (kernel base)

Some other section

Kernel text section

90

Kernel text section

Ryuk-Fuzz Step 2: Guide fuzzing

 Why the interrupt handler is not in kernel text now?

 The side effect of Apple's patch to mitigate Meltdown
vulnerability

 Apple splits user and kernel space, in which interrupt
handler entries are not in kernel text space now

 As a result, kernel text base can not be inferred by the
interrupt handler

91

Ryuk-Fuzz Step 2: Guide fuzzing

 Solution to Error 2: Search backwards from the address
of some other address, e.g. address of _lck_mtx_lock

Get the address of _lck_mtx_lock
