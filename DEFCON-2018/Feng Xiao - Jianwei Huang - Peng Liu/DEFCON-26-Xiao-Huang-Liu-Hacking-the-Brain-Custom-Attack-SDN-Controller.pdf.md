Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging architecture that decouples the network control and forwarding functions.

What's SDN Like Today?
Who are contributing?
 More than 15 popular controllers.  More than 3000 open source SDN projects.
Who are using?

We do NOT assume that hackers can have network access to SDN controllers or SDN applications Control channel is well protected by SSL/TLS A compromised host[1] or switch[2]
[1] exploitable if the target network is configured with in-band control. [2] Switches are vulnerable to multiple remote attacks (e.g., Buffer Overflow[CVE-2016-2074]).

Conclusions
The first attack that can remotely compromise SDN software stack to simultaneously cause multiple kinds of attack effects in SDN controllers.
The data-plane-based attack surface is actually significantly larger than what has been discovered.
Service-logic-free vulnerabilities in the controller could be exploited in unexpected ways to conquer the difficulty brought in by predefined protocol interactions.
