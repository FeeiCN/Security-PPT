IT STARTED WITH A SIMPLE QUESTION...
Are we getting better at communicating useful threat
intel over time?
 2016 Sqrrl | All Rights Reserved

SO I TRIED TO ANSWER THE QUESTION
Focused on "advanced" threats, since that's where most of the reporting is anyway. Feeds & intel sharing sites are out of scope (for now?)
Kiran Bandla's APTNotes site is a great collection of these reports (https://github.com/kbandla/APTnotes)
I analyzed all the 2010 reports, plus a random selection of 2015 reports

WHAT IS THIS INTEL GOOD FOR?

Detection
 If this event happens, I want to know about it.
Attribution
 Who/what is responsible for this activity?
Profiling
 What are the targeting parameters for this threat?
Prediction
 Given the current state, what can I expect from this threat in the future?

There are different types of indicators for different purposes. Most security teams need detection indicators.
Most reports lag events by weeks or months.
If you consume reports, assume low-level indicators are already blown unless otherwise noted.
If you're looking for detection/response intel, most reports are not for you.

IF YOU PRODUCE REPORTS...
Make consumption easier! Keep the documents brief. No one can read all these.  At least, provide a meaty-but-concise exec summary List indicators in an appendix.  Group them by type, with bulleted text for high level
indicators  Include relevant context (actor, kill chain phase, etc)  Provide machine-readable (CSV,JSON, STIX, etc) file to
speed consumption and reduce transcription errors
