Déjà vu all over again

Déjà vu all over again

Last year...
· PCI 2.0 was new. · PCI 2.0 was "fresh". · PCI 2.0 was just as frustrating as PCI 1.x. · PCI 2.0 was still lacking in concrete guidance
on a LOT of things:
­ Mobile devices ­ Virtualization
· So...where the hell are we now?

The Good

Becoming Compliant is not easy

So what?
Does Compliance affect "secure" at all?

We don't know how to measure "secure" so the best we can look at is the frequency & characteristics of incidents, and compare those to PCI.

How difficult and targeted were the attacks?

The Bad

The Bad

Sometimes people cheat

The Ugly

Is History Doomed to Repeat Itself?
· We are doing the same %&$# as a decade ago. · Firewalls. · SSL. · Patches (maybe). · Crypto (sort of). · Can a WAF save us all!?
­ Ahem.

The Ugly

The Solution(s)?
