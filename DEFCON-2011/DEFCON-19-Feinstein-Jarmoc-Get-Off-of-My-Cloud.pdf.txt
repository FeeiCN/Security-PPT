The Public Cloud
3

Brief Introduction to the Amazon Cloud
· First, some terminology and definitions... · Amazon Web Services (AWS) · Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) · Amazon Machine Image (AMI) · Simple Storage Service (S3) · Elastic Block Store (EBS)
4

AWS Security Credentials
· Access Credentials
­ Access Keys ­ X.509 Certificates ­ Amazon EC2 Key Pairs ­ Amazon CloudFront Key Pairs
· Sign-In Credentials
­ Email Address & Password ­ AWS Multi-Factor Authentication Device (optional)
· Account Identifiers
­ AWS Account ID ­ Canonical User ID
5

AWS Access Credentials: Access Keys
· Each Access Key has a public and a secret part
­ Access Key ID
> Unique identifier, Included in each API request
­ Secret Access Key
> Used to calculate a digital signature included in each API request > Amazon validates digital signature to ensure authenticity of each API request
· Managed via "Access Keys" tab of "AWS Security Credentials" page
­ [screenshot]
· Used for making requests to AWS product REST or Query APIs
· Used for SOAP APIs of Amazon S3 and Amazon Mechanical Turk
· Used for making requests to Amazon CloudFront control API
· For security purposes, Amazon recommends rotating Access Keys every 90 days

Managing Access Keys
7

AWS Access Credentials: X.509 Certificates
· AWS can generate certificate and private key files, or user can provide their own certificate
­ Trade-off of convenience versus security
· Managed via "X.509 Certificates" tab of "AWS Security Credentials" page
­ [screenshot]
· Used for making requests to AWS product SOAP APIs
­ ... with the exception of Amazon S3 and Amazon Mechanical Turk
· Also used for "bundling" AMIs, which are encrypted and signed using user's certificate and private key
· For security purposes, Amazon recommends replacing X.509 Certificates every 90 days
8

Managing X.509 Certificates
9

AWS Access Credentials: EC2 Key Pairs
· Created and managed with Amazon EC2 API, or any interface or tool using the API
­ e.g., AWS Management Console ­ [screenshot]
· Comprised of a private key, public key and a key pair name
· Used for launching and connecting to Amazon EC2 instances
­ For Linux/UNIX EC2 instances, used for root SSH access ­ For administrative Remote Desktop access to Windows instances, private
key is used in API call to retrieve and decrypt the administrator password
· No explicit security recommendations from Amazon about key pair rotation
10

AWS Management Console: Key Pairs
11

AWS Access Credentials: CloudFront Key Pairs
· AWS can generate the key pair for you, or user can provide their own
· Trade-off of convenience versus security · Amazon states that while they generate the private key on user's behalf, they do
not store it anywhere
· Comprised of a private key, public key and a key pair name
· Used to generate signed URLs for access to private Amazon CloudFront content
· For security purposes, Amazon recommends rotating Amazon CloudFront key pairs every 90 days
· CloudFront also uses Access Keys to authenticate requests to CloudFront control API
12

Managing Amazon CloudFront Key Pairs
13

AWS Sign-In Credentials: E-mail Address and Password
· Simply an Amazon.com account that is activated for AWS services
· Used for access to secure areas of AWS web site
· Used to access AWS Management Console
· Used to access AWS Discussion Forums and AWS Premium Support
· Amazon's recommended password complexity
­ Minimum of 8 characters ­ Include both uppercase and lowercase letters ­ Include at least 1 numeric digit ­ Include at least one special character
· AWS Multi-Factor Authentication is recommended for additional protection
· Does not appear password complexity is enforced
14

AWS Sign-In Credentials: Multi-Factor Authentication
· Optional AWS account feature recommended for additional security
· Second factor is a six-digit code generated by user's authentication device
· Currently supports Gemalto Ezio Time Token
­ Available for $12.99 in the "Gemalto Webstore for AWS Users"
· Only protects some Amazon web properties
­ Secure pages on the AWS Portal ­ AWS Management Console ­ Notably, does not protect
AWS Premium Support site
· Does not protect AWS service APIs
15

AWS Account Identifiers
· Each AWS account has two unique IDs
­ ( why have one when you can have two, twice as good! )
· AWS Account ID
­ 12 digit number (AWS Account ID without the hyphens) ­ Used to bundle Linux/UNIX AMIs ­ Used to share AWS resources with other AWS accounts
> Amazon EC2 AMI > Amazon EBS snapshot > Amazon SQS queue
· Canonical User ID
­ Used to share Amazon S3 resources with other AWS accounts

· Demonstrated method to get prime placement in AWS list of available AMIs
· Demonstrated ease of getting users to run an untrustworthy AMI

Our Work
· Understanding of AWS credential types and their "order of precedence"
· Understanding of common mistakes / pitfalls
· Tools to detect credential exposure within images
· Tools to detect malicious images / backdoor'd images · Experiment to quantify scale of potential victims of a malicious AMI · Consistent with our reading of the "Amazon Web Services Customer
Agreement" and the "Amazon Web Services Terms of Use"

Mistakes When Creating a Public or Shared AMI
· AMI filesystem
­ AWS Cert + Private Key ­ SSH Key Pairs ­ SSL certs and private keys
· Bash history files containing environmental variable exports or command-line usage of credentials (e.g., Secret Access Key)
· Bash profile (e.g., .bashrc, .bash_profile) containing environmental variable exports
· Contents of .viminfo files
21

Signs of a Compromised / Malicious AMI
· SSH authorized keys · Rootkits · Trojaned binaries
(e.g., sshd) · Open sockets
(e.g., reverse shell / connect back) · Trojaned custom Xen kernel
22

Expanding upon prior work on "Evil AMIs"
· Black Hat USA 2009 / DEF CON 17, Stamos et. al. · We know victims are easy to find, but lets quantify this with data · What size of instances? · How many instances being launched in tandem? · What AWS Regions and Availability Zones being launched in? · Would the instance's AWS Security Group (i.e., EC2 firewall policy)
have prevented remote SSH access, in case of a SSH authorized key?
23

AMIexposed tool
· An extensible framework for scanning AMIs for common credential leakage and security problems
· Uses Amazon's APIs to automate
­ Generation of a list of images within scope ­ Launch instances of each image ­ Run tests via SSH session ­ Record findings to a database
24

AMIexposed: Test Modules
· Presence of SSH authorized_keys
­ Potential backdoor
· Presence of SSH identity keys
­ Can be used to gain illicit access to other hosts
· Presence of AWS x.509 certificate (.pem) files
­ Can be used to tamper with publisher's EC2 account
· Active connections to other hosts
­ Potential backdoors
· SSH Password authentication enabled
25

Tests Against Discovered System Files
· .bash_history, .vim_info, .bash_profile, .bashrc (in any path) and · Anything found under Bash /etc/profile.d · AWS Access Key or Secret Key strings
­ Can be used to gain full access to owner's EC2 account
· Canonical ID
­ Identifies an AWS account for use with S3
· AWS Account ID
­ Identifies an AWS account
· Environment variable names which commonly point to these values
26

· Findings being coordinated with Amazon Web Services security team · To be presented during DEF CON presentation, with updated slides
available online after presentation

· A number of 3rd party vendors also provide their own images · Organizations can use AWS supported and maintained images as a
foundation for their own customized images
