Countermeasures of theft
1. Lock your desk and door when ever you leave (even for a short time). Do not leave your wallet, purse, credit cards, cash, checkbook, or other valuables in the open.
2. Never prop open exterior doors. If you see a door propped, close it.
3. Never allow people you do not know to "tailgate" behind you into the building! Every person who is authorized to be in your building should have either card access or a key. Politely tell them that you cannot allow them in and that they need to contact security
4. Never loan your Company ID card to anyone. If you misplace it, report it to security immediately.
5. Never leave your laptop computer, cell-phone, book bag, purse or other valuables unattended.
6. If you see a suspicious person or someone you don't believe should be in or around the building call Security or the police immediately.

Countermeasures for violence in the workplace
1. Train management and employees to recognize the warning signs of potential workplace violence. 2. When faced with a threat, hire extra security and provide employees with sufficient warning and
instructions. 3. Make certain that all employees/victims know that reporting workplace violence, harassment, and/or
threats will not affect their job status. 4. Set up a code word that receptionists can use to alert a coworker if a potentially dangerous individual
arrives at the reception area. 5. Conduct regular training sessions to teach managers and supervisors how to recognize the warning signs
of violence and minimize potentially violent situations in the workplace. 6. Conduct routine safety checks and maintenance of features in and around the workplace, including
emergency exits, alarms, security lighting, surveillance cameras, and/or metal detectors.

Countermeasure for Corporate Espionage
1. Since a majority of information stolen is in the physical form, companies should shred all documents before they are discarded
2. Do not print sensitive company information unless it is absolutely necessary. Then immediately place the information in a secure envelope or place until it reaches the intended party. Information lying around on a desk may be easily copied, photographed, or stolen.
3. Secure all necessary printed documents in a locked file cabinet. Keep the cabinets locked when the cabinets are not in use.
4. Companies should invest in technology that prevents documents with sensitive company information from being copied.
5. Companies may set access controls within software indicating authorized parties that are allowed to print specific runs of specific documents. This will prevent individuals from carelessly printing materials which may expose the company to unnecessary risks.
6. Print encryption is another method to protect sensitive company information. When a document is printed, it hides sensitive information in the print fields where the encryption occurs. The information encrypted may only be viewed by individuals who possess the authority to view the information.
