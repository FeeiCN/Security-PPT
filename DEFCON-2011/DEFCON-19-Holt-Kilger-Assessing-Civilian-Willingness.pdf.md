Political Conflict On and Off-Line
· There has been significant attention in popular media on the role of technology in political conflict across the globe over the last few years · The Danish Cartoon Attacks · Russia/Estonia Conflict · Egypt · Iran · "Operation Payback" Anonymous attacks
2

Political Conflict On and Off Line
· Asymetric warfare and civilian attack is now a realistic and cost-effective attack vector
­ Restructuring power relationships between the individual and the nation-state
· Technology is a useful mechanism for several reasons
­ Near real time communication ­ Potential level of damage can be significant ­ Low cost ­ Anonymity ­ Minimal legal risk depending on activity
3

Preliminary Data and Model Statistical Model Building
· We are starting to get some preliminary data
­ Respondents are undergrad and grad students at a large Midwest university
· Also beginning to build some preliminary statistical models · We're looking for other universities to collaborate with for
cross-national comparisons

Different Social Dimensions Under Investigation as Related to Civilian Cyber Warrior Behavior
· Civilian Cyber Warrior study is concentrating on.. ­ Dependent variables
· Willingness to commit acts of cyber terror against another country · Willingness to commit acts of cyber terror against their own country · Willingness to commit acts of physical terror against another country · Willingness to commit acts of physical terror against their own country

Different Social Dimensions Under Investigation as Related to Civilian Cyber Warrior Behavior
· Civilian Cyber Warrior study is concentrating on..
· Independent predictor variables including ­ Level of skill ­ Level of emotive national identity ­ Level of nationalistic ethnocentrism ­ Level of antagonism towards outgroups ­ Level of belief in equality for groups ­ Level of piracy of software and media ­ Homeland ­ US or non-US declared as homeland ­ Demographics
10

Independent Variables
· Emotive National identity
­ I am proud to be a citizen of my home country. ­ In a sense I am emotionally attached to my home country and am
emotionally affected by its actions. ­ Although at times I may not agree with the government, my
commitment to my home country always remains strong. ­ I feel a great pride in the land that is my home country. ­ When I see my home country's flag flying I feel great. ­ The fact that I am a citizen of my home country is an important
part of my identity.
11

Independent Variables
· Belief in Group Equality
­ It would be good if groups could be equal. ­ Group equality should be our ideal. ­ All groups should be given an equal chance in life. ­ We should do what we can to equalize conditions for
different groups. ­ We would have fewer problems if we treated people more
equally. ­ We should strive to make incomes as equal as possible. ­ No group should dominate in society.
12

Independent Variables
· Outgroup Antagonism
­ Some groups of people are simply inferior to other groups.
­ If certain groups stayed in their place, we would have fewer problems.
­ It's probably a good thing that certain groups are at the top and other groups are at the bottom.
­ Inferior groups should stay in their place. ­ Sometimes other groups must be kept in their place.
13

Independent Variables
· Nationalistic Ethnocentricity
­ Other countries should try to make their government as much like my home country's government as possible.
­ Generally, the more influence my home country has on other nations, the better off they are.
­ Foreign nations have done some very fine things but my home country does things in the best way of all.
· Age
· Gender
14

Independent Variables
­ What country do they consider their homeland? · United States · Non-United States
· Pirating software or media ­ Two separate questions "How many times in the last 12 months have you knowingly downloaded, used, or made copies of... software ... media"
· Computer Skill ­ Advanced Skill Factor ­ Using an operating system like Unix or Linux ­ Using a standard computer programming or scripting language like C++, Perl, or Java ­ Installing an operating system like Unix or Linux
15

Predicting Cyber Attack Against Homeland
· Using these independent variables in a multiple regression analysis, it appears that four factors predict cyber attacks against their homeland ­ Emotive national identity**
· Negative relationship ­ less emotional identity equals more severe cyber attack magnitude
­ Homeland support*
· Non-US homeland individuals more severe cyber attack than US homeland individuals
­ Willingness to perform a physical attack***
· Positive relationship ­ more severe physical attack means more severe cyber attack
­ Pirate software or media***
· Positive relationship ­ more piracy activity means more severe cyber attack
16

Predicting Physical Attack Against Homeland
· Using these independent variables in a multiple regression analysis, it appears that five factors predict physical attacks against their homeland
­ Advanced cyber skills*
· Positive relationship - the higher the technical skills of the individual the more severe the physical attack
­ Homeland support*
· US homeland individuals more severe physical attack than non-US homeland individuals
­ Willingness to perform a cyber attack***
· Positive relationship ­ the more severe the physical attack means the more severe cyber attack contemplated
­ Pirate software or media***
· Positive relationship ­ more piracy activity means more severe cyber attack
17

Predicting Physical Attack Against Homeland
· Using these independent variables in a multiple regression analysis, it appears that five factors predict physical attacks against their homeland ­ Outgroup antagonism*
· Negative relationship - the lower level of antagonism towards groups not like themselves, the more severe the physical attack
· That is, the more sympathetic to groups of people unlike themselves, the more severe the physical attack on their own homeland ­ "the activist effect"
18

Next Steps
· Work on building foreign country cyber and physical attack statistical models
· Continue to gather more data and refine analyses · Encourage collaboration in collecting data from other
universities both in the US and other countries
­ Other country data useful for cross-national comparisons
