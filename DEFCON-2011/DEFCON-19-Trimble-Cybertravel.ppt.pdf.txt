The Future of Cybertravel: Legal Implications of the Evasion of Geolocation

What is this talk about?

Marketa Trimble

 What the law has (or does not have) to say about evasion of geolocation or "cybertravel" ­ about acts by which a user makes geolocation tools believe that he is physically located somewhere other than where he is located.

 Example: I sit in the U.S. but use MyExpatNetwork.co.uk to acquire a U.K. IP address and appear as though I am connected to the internet from the U.K.

 Is this legal? Does the law care? Will the law care in the future?
