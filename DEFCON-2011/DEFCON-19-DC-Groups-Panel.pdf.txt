· (1)  Defcon  Groups  Logo   · (2)  A  Really,  Really  Brief  History  of  the  DCG  
­ (3)  late  2002  ideas  led  to  creaWon  of  Defcon  Groups   ­ (4)  was  one  of  a  dozen  or  so  folks  starWng  a  group  
· group  would  be  great  and  far  exceed  the  awesomeness  of  our   local  2600  (or  so  I  thought)  
­ (5)  officially  launched  in  2003  at  Defcon  11  
· (6)  reality  of  local  207  
­ (7)  trekked  to  Oregon  and  parWcipated  in  503  scene  
· highs,  lows,  but  everyone  got  busy

­ (8)  moved  to  Sea[le  and  found  the  thriving  206  
· more  hackers!  
· (9)  And  the  Years  Passed  
­ most  acWve  groups  off  doing  their  own  thing   ­ many  groups  looking  to  abandon  the  Defcon  
banner  in  favor  of  hackerspaces  
· they  have  much  cooler  names  
­ many  groups  simply  didn't  exist  or  respond  
· began  with  a  list  of  over  170+  groups  internaWonally   · 102  were  inacWve!  (seriously,  I  have  the  list  to  prove  it)   · 30  had  significantly  changed;  hey,  I'd  not  been  the  POC  
for  DC207  for  over  6  years!
