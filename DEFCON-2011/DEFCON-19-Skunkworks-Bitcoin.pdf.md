WHY was Bitcoin created?
 High fees with current e-payment solutions  Paypal (and others) playing big brother  Increase in decentralized digital technologies, eg torrents

WHAT is Bitcoin and WHO made it?
 A decentralized Peer-to-Peer currency  No central authority  Transactions verified by peers  Over $100,000,000 US in value  "Money" printed by GPUs  Enigmatic developer Satoshi Nakamoto who left in 2010

The Economics of Bitcoin
Hackers? In my Economy? It's more likely than you think!
 Bitcoin is Fiat currency, just like USD  It has built in deflation, never more than 21,000,000 BTC  Can be traded down to 0.00000001BTC  Generated by GPUs (or ASICs?), backed by the marginal
utility of a Semi-Anonymous virtual currency  Not a Ponzi Scheme, but the early adopters got rich  Price up over 200,000%, rampant speculation due to
media coverage and novelty of currency type  Will likely find an equilibrium price due to many factors

A chart is fine too...
 $0.06 to $30 in a few months, this scale is logarithmic!  Who made big bucks?

SHA-256, the block chain and GPUs
 Bitcoin algorithm based on SHA-256  GPUs are hundreds of times faster than CPUs  Every transaction is hashed and becomes part of the
"block chain"  Coins stored in a wallet.dat file  The entire network is many times more powerful than
folding@home or the RIEKN supercomputer  Mining pooled to a large degree, fees are making top pool
operators rich

Attack Vector: Botnets and Bitcoin
 These attacks rely on overwhelming the network with illegitimate clients or a lot of hashing power
 Forking the block chain if you control over 50% of the network hashing power
 "Cancer nodes" refusing to relay blocks and process transactions, allowing double-spending and network stoppage
 Half of the hashing power would represent over $120,000 per day for the attacker, making an attack attractive
 A botnet for financial gain that doesn't harm the network could be running today
 A supermassive botnet can create total market-power

Attack Vector: Botnets and Bitcoin
 "Timejacking" a node requires a fairly small botnet  Bitcoin will drop a connection to a peer sending too much data,
making DoS a bit harder, at least requiring more nodes.  No way to tell the difference between a botnet that "plays by the
rules" and a bunch of legitimate users  The most lucrative use of a botnet in the long term may not be
attacking the network, but contributing to it  "Rule abiding" botnets could represent a significant fraction of
today's hashing power and we wouldn't know

Attack Vector: Pickpocketing wallet.dat
 Not all users are level 31337 computer scientists  wallet.dat is unencrypted  Many daytraders and speculators, a few dimwits  Specialized Trojan Horses target Windows  Limewire. Wait, Limewire!?  Don't put all your eggs in one unprotected basket, just ask
"Allinvain" who lost $500,000 in a single wallet.dat file  See en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Securing_your_wallet

Attack Vector: Third Parties
 Third-parties such as currency exchanges and giftcard services provide fertile attack ground, each attack would be site specific
 Mt. Gox 0wned, had old unsalted password hashes, $9 million attempted sell off of compromised accounts crashed market, forced a freeze on trading for almost a week
 Deepbit.net 0wned, unspecified amount taken when payout addresses changed, cost eaten by site admin
 Many bitcoin related sites don't yet take as security-conscious a view as established banks

Attack Vector: The Gullible Users
 Bitcoin 419 Scams  Fake Giftcard payouts  Fake investment sites  Fake currency exchanges  "I'm a Nigerian Prince who has won 89 Million Bitcoins and I just
need you to pay my Bitcoin transfer fee so you can claim 10%"  There is no patch for human stupidity, a fool and their bitcoins
are soon parted

Attack Vector: High Frequency Trading
 Constant computerized trading of a financial holding based miniscule market fluctuations with the intent to turn a small profit thousands of times
 "High rollers" can assert partial market power, execute high frequency trading with good results by single handedly moving the market
 High Frequency Trading is quite slow on the actual Bitcoin network, would be carried out through third parties

Attack Vector: The "Finney" Attack
 Accepting a 0-confirmation transaction creates the problem  Attacker sends coins to himself in an unbroadcasted block,
"spends" coins, the coins sent to the attacker's own address take precedence  The problem with a bitcoin vending machine

Drugs, Weapons and Money Laundering
Oh, so that's where the bad press is from?
 Silkroad marketplace trades in (mostly) illegal wares, relies on the supposed anonymity of Bitcoin for plausible deniability of financial transfers proceeding shipment
 Money laundering is trivial with Bitcoin, again relying on the supposed anonymity of the network
 Represents a nice shiny object for the media to peck at

P.W.N.T. by a L.E.A.: So maybe Bitcoin isn't so anonymous after all...
 It is public information what address has what bitcoins, and from who they were received
 If you can tie a few addresses to a few people, and people use only one address, anonymity is out the window
 High level network monitoring can possibly identify many bitcoin users
 eWallet providers are somewhat of a solution, but introduce third party issues

ASICs: The Darkhorse
 A few watts per chip, versus 100+ for a GPU  Very high upfront development costs and effort  Possibility to create network-scale hashing capability with
millions in investment  Already deployed in at least one mining operation  May already represent a substantial portion of network hashing
power in relative secrecy

I accidentally the GPU market...
 Global shortages of AMD Radeon HD 5000 series GPUs  Best price/performance GPUs selling used for upwards of 150%
retail on ebay, craigslist, etc  Individual buyers hoarding dozens of GPUs for resale or mining  Sellouts within minutes of restocking on Newegg  Radeon HD 6000 series and Nvidia are lower performing  Radeon HD 7000 series leaked specs reveal rough
comparability with 5000 series for bitcoin mining

Miscellaneous
 "But I'm growing currency, officer" - high power bill leads to fruitless raid of suspected weed growing operation
