From the DEF CON 19 CFP: Okay, let's get sneaky...

Covert
 without the subject's knowledge
Post-Exploitation
 after a remote compromise, local backdoor
Forensics
 reconstructing data above and beyond what the subject anticipates

Forensics and penetration testing/
other offensive operations

For the forensics geeks...
No subject location, no problem Surreptitious acquisition and analysis

?

Familiar tools...

For the penetration testing geeks...
Potential for more important data gathered per compromised system
"We don't keep that data"
Multiple revisions of files, old data
Data carving
General purpose scripting
Stealthy!

Typical Forensics Examination Scenarios
 Hardware seizure  Authorized software agents  On-site  "Suspect"/Subject is aware

Covert Remote Forensics
 Unaware Subject  No known physical location?  Not a deal-killer.  Remote imaging  Remote block device access

Ears perking up yet?
 Intelligence  Penetration testers upping post-
exploitation game
 Compliance  Criminal

Forensics for people who break things
Semester-long class
Week-long LE Courses
Talk to Pent este rs

File System Forensic
Capabilities
 Allocated files  Deleted files  Slack space  Disk/Volume  Unallocated space  Deletion vs. Formatting vs.Wiping  Imaging

Slack Space Example
Sector size: 512 bytes Cluster size: 4 sectors File size: 4150 bytes
RAM Slack (probably 0'd) Disk Slack (potential goodies)

Can't I do this already?
 Load sleuth kit up onto the compromised target?  Probably will work but...  ...stomping on deleted files  ...not that stealthy  ...a little less slick than what I'm proposing:

Enter Railgun
 "Patrick HVE" - Are you out there? Massive thanks!

If we can call Windows API remotely...
 ...then we can access physical/logical block devices directly
 ...which means we can read arbitrary sectors from the disk
 ...why not map remote block devices to local ones?

Metasploit Post
Modules
 enum_drives.rb  Helper/Support  imager.rb  byte-for-byte imaging  Hashing  Split images  Cool, but..........

nbd_server.rb!
 Run forensic tools locally, on local block devices that are mapped to remote block devices!
 API calls made over meterpreter shell  NBD (Network Block Device)  Easy way to get programmatic block
devices in Linux
 Read-only (forensic write-blocking)  Direct remote access with off-the-shelf/
commercial/open-source tools

Stupid Protocol Tricks
iSCSI NBD Meterpreter/Railgun Windows API Disk

Caveats and exercises for the reader
 Network  Speed  Stealth  Cleaner/cross-platform implementation  Pure ruby iSCSI?

Conclusions
 Go and wring more data out of systems!  Builds capability for forensic examiners and
penetration testers
 Encourage secure wiping
