camera/ · 8 seconds of video · 600 meter range · Fin-Stabilized Spring out Wings for Range extension · From 40mm Grenade Launcher, which must be a Registered DD
(Destructive Device) Approx $2k · Military Usage · Not available to most civilians · Deployment time is good, a few seconds · Uses standard equipment carried by military units. (40mm Grenade
Launcher) · Ballistic Decommission ­ End of flight = Shatter!

Safety
DIY Destructive Devices can go wrong.
VERY WRONG!
If you ever hear someone with a grenade launcher
go,
"Hey, y'all, someone hold my beer! Now watch this!!"
RUN!

Safety 2
· WARNING! DO NOT DO THIS AT HOME! DO NOT MAKE THESE SHELLS OR BUILD THIS SYSTEM
· Do NOT disassemble 37mm or 40mm shells! · We are experts. No, really. · Please do not do this. · If you want, call/email us. We will happily
discuss it with you, including the possible dangers.

Safety 3
Hand Orientation Right hand on pistol grip Left hand BEHIND the shell Not on `hand guard'
Fragmentation Vest Flash Suit Gloves Helmet Eye Protection Ear Protection No Such thing as overkill when its your fingers and eyeballs

Legality
· 37mm vs. 40mm ·Non-DD vs Destructive Device · NFA 1934 · ¼ Ounce of Explosive/Propellant/Lift Charge · PC 120301(a)(4) ­ "Penal Code" ($200,000 fine + Jail time)

Capability 37mm non-DD
·1/2lb projectile 400 meters range ·1/4lb 400 feet vertically ·25000 PSI in high pressure chamber

Why our system is not DD
·Total weight of lift charge/payload ·Intent ­ Signal, Search and Rescue ·Non-antipersonnel ·37mm ·Never ever aim at individuals.

Challenges - Electronics
· Documentation in Engrish · Range issues · Repeatability · DOA Equipment · Locating proper cameras

Challenges ­ Shell Design and Propulsion
· Safety!! · Legality (rectal opening safety) · Camera-system arming · Temperature during ignition · G forces during the boost phase · Space · Camera orientation · Timing

Camera-System Arming
· Spin-Arm · Ripcord · Magnetic reed switch · Pushbutton

Challenges Launch, Stabilization, Recovery
· Stabilizing fin deployment · Camera orientation · Powder burns · Parachute deployment · `helicopter' recovery · Tangle lines

Failure is always an option.
· Chute/Streamer deployment · Camera stabilization · Failure to fire · Delayed ignition · Explosion · Electronics failure · Trees and buildings jump in the way

Shell Loading ­ Safety and "Issues"
· Safety! Do you want to see the hand again? · Weight · Fine Particles · Crushed primers · Packing propellant

Shell Loading ­ Procedures and demo
· Primer · Propellant in high-pressure chamber · Blast-disk · Cardboard lug · Fireproof wadding · Camera/Parachute package · Insert battery pin · Cover cap

Electronics "Issues"
· Wiring · Battery pack issues
­ 6 volts? ­ Lithium vs. Alkaline? ­ Button Cells?
· Eyesight

Testing Issues
· Safety! Talk to the HAND!!!!!! · Location ­ Just where do you test a grenade
launcher? Hmmm? · Data logging
