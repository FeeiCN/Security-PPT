Why you should be skeptical
· I am not a lawyer · My presentation is (both) unintentionally
and intentionally biased by my own beliefs · This isn't a political presentation, but it is
inevitably influenced by political issues · Bottom line: Don't take my word for it; read
the source material and make up your own mind!

Virginia Declaration of Rights
(1776)
X That general warrants, whereby any officer or messenger may be commanded to search suspected places without evidence of a fact committed, or to seize any person or persons not named, or whose offense is not particularly described and supported by evidence, are grievous and oppressive and ought not to be granted.

State Constitutions
Of the ten states that adopted constitutions between the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution:
­ Three expressed condemned general warrants (Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina)
­ Three included provisions similar to the eventual language of the Fourth Amendment (Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Vermont)

(1833) and apply the Bill of Rights to the states
­ Privileges or Immunities Clause (Slaughterhouse Cases)
­ Due Process Clause (Wolf v. Colorado, 1949; Mapp v. Ohio, 1961)

Part II: The Fourth Amendment
WTF HAPPENED TO THE CONSTITUTION?

Fourth Amendment
The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.

Search by government?
Reasonably expect privacy? Standing?
Was there a warrant?
Was warrant proper and executed correctly?

Police good faith? Inevitable Discovery? Independent source? No?
No?
Search Valid

Search Valid
Warrant Exception?
*Incident to arrest *Auto search *Plain view *Consent *Stop & frisk *Hot pursuit/evanescent evidence
Search Valid

Key questions
· Was the action performed by the government?
· Was there a reasonable expectation of privacy?
· Was there a warrant? · Was the warrant proper and executed
correctly?

Was the action performed by the government?
· Someone acting in an official capacity on behalf of the federal or state government
· Can be a federal or state official, or a private individual acting on behalf of the federal or state government

Was there a reasonable expectation of privacy?
· A government intrusion only constitutes a "search" when there is a reasonable expectation of privacy
· Otherwise, it is not a search and the Fourth Amendment does not apply

Reasonable expectation of privacy
1. Actual expectation of privacy 2. Your expectation is reasonable to society
as a whole

Reasonable expectation of privacy

Reasonable expectation of privacy

Reasonable expectation of privacy
· Inside / outside (home) · Inside / outside (container) · Inside / outside (body) · Content / non-content (digital) · Private / shared (social network)

Was there a warrant?
· Consent · Plain view · Open fields · Curtilage · Exigent circumstances · Motor vehicle

Was the warrant proper and executed correctly?
· Proper:
­ Probable cause ­ Particularity ­ Neutral magistrate
· Signed under oath · PC not stale/out of date
· Execution:
­ Timely / Time of day ­ Knock and announce ­ Search only areas listed in warrant ­ Seize only items listed in warrant & plain view

Exceptions to the Exclusionary Rule
· Good faith · Inevitable discovery · Independent source · Intervening acts

Burden of proof
· Reasonable suspicion · Probable cause · Preponderance of the evidence · Beyond reasonable doubt

Part III: Things That Should Piss You Off WTF HAPPENED TO THE CONSTITUTION?

Things that should piss you off
1. Administrative searches 2. Administrative warrants and subpoenas 3. Public surveillance 4. Schools and students' rights 5. Legislators, judges and technology 6. It's your fault, too

Administrative searches
· What is it? A search conducted as part of a general regulatory scheme
· Why is it problematic? Generally, administrative searches are considered reasonable if they are no more intrusive or intensive than necessary and thus not subject to further Fourth Amendment scrutiny; pre-textual for criminality
· What can we do about it? Demonstrate that searches are increasingly intrusive in light of current technology
· Verdict: tough row to hoe

Administrative warrants and subpoenas
· What is it? Authorizes searches for regulatory schemes, or to obtain "noncontent" information
· Why is it problematic? Some forms of administrative warrants or subpoenas, such as National Security Letters, have very little judicial oversight; PC not required?
· What can we do about it? Continue to support efforts to publicize abuse
· Verdict: Doe v. Ashcroft began to rollback NSLs; but more work must continue

Public surveillance
· What is it? Surveillance cameras, GPS tracking, marking our every move
· Why is it problematic? Long term surveillance, technology increases the intrusion even in public spaces; amassing of data without suspicion
· What can we do about it? Use privacyenhancing technologies to our advantage; publicize known and obvious abuses
· Verdict: Are we too far down the slippery slope?

Schools and students' rights
· What is it? Students are often denied the same basic rights as other citizens
· Why is it problematic? While there are legitimate concerns about disrupting an educational environment, this reason is often used as a pretext to invade students' civil rights
· What can we do about it? Parents must continue to stay informed about their children and stand up for their rights
· Verdict: Students rights have eroded since Tinker

Legislators, judges and technology
· What is it? Many legislators and judges show little aptitude for understanding technology that
· Why is it problematic? Technologically incompetent legislators write poor laws, judges make poor decisions; ultimately, the justice system becomes undermined
· What can we do about it? Technology education, technology courts, run for office yourself?
· Verdict: an uphill battle, but one worth fighting

Specialty courts
· Bankruptcy Courts · U.S. Court of International Trade · U.S. Court of Federal Claims · Court of Appeals for Veterans' Claims · U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces
· Technology Courts?

It's your fault, too
· What is it? We share a lot of information voluntarily
· Why is it problematic? By openly sharing so much information, we lower the overall societal expectation of privacy and thus subject ourselves to more governmental intrusion
· What can we do about it? Just because we can share, doesn't mean we have to
· Verdict: Another case where we might be too far down the slope to reverse course

Voluntary disclosure of privacy

Some Final Observations
WTF HAPPENED TO THE CONSTITUTION?

Unresolved questions
· Is email privacy protected by the Fourth Amendment? [Warshak v. United States]
· Is warrantless GPS tracking constitutional? [United States v. Jones]
· Can your cell phone be searched during a traffic stop? Is a warrant required to search it after an arrest? [People v. Diaz, CA and State v. Smith, OH]
· Can the government force you to reveal a password for an encrypted device? [United States v. Fricosu]

Is privacy dead?
· Perhaps not yet, but it's dying fast · We can reclaim privacy by protecting our
information and refusing to share so much voluntarily, and in turn increasing society's expectation of privacy · Increase awareness by shining the light on governmental intrusions into privacy rights · Shift our focus

A new focus
· Do you have the right to wear red hats on Wednesdays? Why or why not? Or should we ask the question another way?
· Enumerated powers, Ninth Amendment, Tenth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment
· Islands of liberty in a sea of power, or islands of power in a sea of liberty?
· Only you can make a difference for you
