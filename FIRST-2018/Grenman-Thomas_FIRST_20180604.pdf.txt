Incident Handling Flow
 The incident process cover everything from identification of a reported case up to closure and follow up of the final incident report
 Customers rarely report incidents directly to PSIRT, instead they file support cases
 The first step of the handling process is to determine if the incident is product related and if privacy aspects need to be taken into account
 Potential privacy incidents with activate the privacy officer(s) and trigger a subprocess for determining Ericsson's relationship to the Data Subjects

Privacy and Security Incident Relationship

Protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, modification or destruction

SECURITY INCIDENT

PRIVACY INCIDENT

Respecting a fundamental right to the protection of personal data

Incident Triage
 Appoint an incident lead  Verify and record provided initial information  If applicable, support in assessing the privacy impact  Identify the urgency and criticality in order to prioritize the case  Create a response strategy plan (and keep it updated)  Identify and handshake with essential stakeholders (e.g., administrators,
technical experts, KAMs, service delivery manager, privacy officers, etc.)  Determine the need to preserve forensic evidence  Clarify the outcome and the expectations of the incident investigation

Privacy Incident vs. Privacy Breach

Incident Communications
 Keep stakeholder up-to-date during investigation
 regional service delivery managers  involved product organization  customer
 Additional communications for privacy incidents
 approve all communications through appointed privacy officer  depending on the local legislation, communicate with DPA, other public
authorities and directly with data subjects (if needed)
 If needed, PSIRT will assist in formulating a privacy breach notification

Common Causes of Privacy Incidents
 Lack of security controls
 loss of equipment containing data  transfer, sale or disposal of equipment containing data (without wiping it first)  use of equipment without adequate transfer or storing protection for data  failing to protecting against intrusion into equipment containing data  insufficient rights to access or modify data (e.g., wrongful access, tampering)  inadequate security or access controls for data in print or electronic format  processing data without or in contradiction with consent

Common Causes of Privacy Incidents (cont.)
 Lack of privacy controls
 low privacy awareness and data handling competence within staff, contractors and third parties
 lack or inadequate provisions to protect privacy in contracts or in agreements on processing and information sharing
 lack of data recognition  transfer of data outside country without adequate protection measures  lack or privacy processes or policies at Data Controller's or Processor's end  lack of policy implementations or consent management in product, services,
and operations

Key Takeaways
 As a Data Controller or Data Processor
 know the data, know where it is stored, know the local legislation  have (rehearsed) processes in place, have well-defined responsibilities  agree on communications channels, get to know the local DPA, agree on
templates (e.g., breach notification)  avoid making contracts that can block or slow down your investigation  transfer legal liability for data protection to parties involved in data processing  employ forensic investigators or keep a shortlist of local third parties that
quickly can aid with needed technical investigation  have the technical capability to notify victims (potentially in the millions)

Key Takeaways (cont.)
 As a technology provider
 identify and document personal data being processed by the product  have requirements in place to ensure that the product privacy impact is assessed  implement needed technical features to
 allow classification of personal data according to local regulation and law  ensure high data quality (allow updating or deleting outdated information)  enable data de-identification, anonymization, and scheduled erasures acc. to retention times  enable data transfers (through machine-readable exports and imports)  allow fine grained access controls to all processed data item  protect confidentiality and integrity of personal data at rest and when in transfer  collect sufficient logging (i.e., audit trails) for all vital privacy related events
