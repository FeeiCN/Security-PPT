Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy
https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/reference-incident-classification-taxonomy
3

Problems...just to name a few
 There are many terms  There are many taxonomies  There are different versions of the same taxonomy  Different references to the same taxonomy often point
to different taxonomy versions!
4

Why ?
 Taxonomy for CSIRT technical incidents  To ensure that CSIRTs are speaking the same language.  To facilitate sharing across CSIRTs.  To facilitate the harmonization of statistics between the CSIRT
community.  To facilitate translation between different taxonomies, without
disruption or need for major overhaul.  Could be useful mapping within the context of NIS directive.  Get ready for automated info exchange

Reference Taxonomy Task Force
 Develop Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy for CSIRTs in Europe
 Define and develop an Update and Versioning Mechanism
 Host reference document
 Organise regular physical meetings with the stakeholders

eCSIRT.net mkVI (starting point)
 First version 2003  Good starting point  Main categories are still
current, practical and universal  Could be easily used to map
other existing taxonomies

Common Taxonomy CSIRT-LEA

 Adaptation of the CERT.PT taxonomy, which is itself an adaptation of the eCSIRT.net mkVI taxonomy.
 Used in the context of law enforcement
 It has been extended to also include a mapping of the incident classifications with a legal framework.
 Resulted from CSIRT LEA annual workshop and it is constantly updated and reviewed by the taxonomy governance group TGG
 Members of the TGG are part of the reference taxonomy task force to ensure sync & synergies

Pivot Translation
Reference taxonomy as a pivot language to map existing taxonomies and facilitate
info exchange.

Next steps
Decide on two elemental points  Confirm eCSIRT.net as starting point  Decide on the granularity of the sub levels Review and consolidate Incident Classifications and definitions in the reference taxonomy Define update workflow and versioning mechanism Decide about the hosting of the reference taxonomy Propose way forward, e.g.: to meet periodically
