REQUIREMENTS FOR CSIRT IN ORGANIZATION IN MALAYSIA

In 2013, the National Security
Council of Malaysia (NSC) released the guideline NSC Directive 24: National Cyber Crisis Management Mechanism.

This directive specifies the requirement for all government agencies to establish their own CSIRT as one of the initiatives to
manage cyber incidents

In 2013, the latest version of the ISMS standard (27001:2013(E)) contains three additional sub clauses under paragraph A16.1, which
emphasize on response and assessment of information security
incidents:

1. A 16.1.5 Response to information security incidents
2. A 16.1.6 Learning from information security incidents
3. A 16.1.7 Collection of evidence

CONCLUSION
· CSIRT Workflow Management should include elements of Detection, Eradication & Forensic
· It work for us!
­ effective CSIRT implementation ­ effective governance for managing incidents
· Communication, collaboration and information sharing are critical in CSIRT management
· If we can predict attacks, we can be well prepared and provided early alerts to computer users
