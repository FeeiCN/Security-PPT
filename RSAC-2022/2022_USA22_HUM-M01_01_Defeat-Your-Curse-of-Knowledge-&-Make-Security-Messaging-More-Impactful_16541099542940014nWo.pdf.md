Hillary Shulman, Asst. Professor of Communication, Ohio State University

How to apply your new knowledge
Next week: Choose a security message & analyze it for your audience's understandability, personal impact, and helpfulness. Write several versions to see which feels most impactful. Bonus: Ask your audience which kinds of messages help them most. In the next 3 - 6 months: Practice the analysis regularly so it becomes part of your skillset. Help your team reach these same goals, if possible. Bonus: Ask your audience if the messages are more helpful and why. Adjust as needed.
