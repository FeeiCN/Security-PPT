Panel
The goal of this panel is to discuss  Where and in what situations can ZKPs be deployed today?  What applications can one envisage in the coming years?  What does one need to keep in mind when deploying such technologies?  What are the limitations of the technology, both now and inherently?  How is standardization going?  Are there different recommended ZKPoK technologies for different applications?  ..... To fix some terminology I will first give a quick overview

#RSAC

Verifiable Computation/Zero-Knowledge Proofs
VC and ZKPs allow us to solve the following problem... How can we ask someone to compute something on our behalf and be sure it has been done correctly? VC is used when the computing party has no secret information ZKPs are used when the computing party has some secret information In both situations VCs and ZKPs provide integrity....
"Integrity is doing the right thing, even when no one is watching." A quote often misattributed to C.S. Lewis

#RSAC
Verifiable Computation/Zero-Knowledge Proofs

F(x,y,z) f,

a,b,c
f= F(a,b,c) 

The computing party has some data a,b,c that it has "committed" to in some way
Someone asks for the function F to be computed on this data
This is done and a proof  is also sent back
 is "zero knowledge" in the sense it reveals nothing about a, b or c. Except they were used as inputs to the computation.
If there is no secret information then the proof is just a proof that f has been computed correctly (this is the VC setting)

#RSAC
Verifiable Computation/Zero-Knowledge Proofs

F(x,y,z) f,

Efficiency Questions:

How complex a function F can one deal
a,b,c with?

f= F(a,b,c) 

What is the size of the proof ?
How fast is the prover in terms of size of F?
How fast is the verifier in terms of size of F or size of ?

Is a costly set-up procedure needed?

Is the set-up procedure independent of F?

#RSAC
Verifiable Computation/Zero-Knowledge Proofs

F(x,y,z) f,

Security Questions:

a,b,c

Is the procedure post-quantum secure?
Does the set-up procedure need to be trusted?

f= F(a,b,c) 

What is the probability that a cheating prover can succeed? [Soundness]
What security is offered for the prover's secrets? [Zero-Knowledge]

#RSAC
SNARKS vs STARKS vs Bullet-Proofs vs MPC-in-theHead
There are (at-least) five general purpose Zero-Knowledge technologies which are currently practical
 ZK-SNARKs: Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge  ZK-STARKs: Scalable Transparent ARguments of Knowledge  Bullet-Proofs:  MPC-in-the-Head:  Designated Verifier Proofs: DV-Proofs such as Mac-n-Cheese
Each technology has a different trade off in terms of performance and security

#RSAC

SNARKS vs STARKS vs Bullet-Proofs vs MPC-in-theHead

Proof Size *:
SNARKs (~128 Bytes) Bullet-Proofs (~1.3 KBytes) STARKs (45-200 KBytes)
Prover Time:
STARKs < SNARKs << BulletProofs
Verifier Time *:
SNARKs (~5 msec) STARKs (~16 msec) Bullet-Proofs (~1.1 sec)

Trusted Set-Up Required:
SNARK
Post-Quantum Secure:
STARKs, MPC-in-the Head, Modern DV-Proofs
DV-Proofs are more efficient than all others (in every respect), but one has a designated verifier.

MPC-in-the-Head vs STARKs:
MPC-in-the-Head and STARKs are both forms of IOP proofs, so comparable.
MPC-in-the-Head is more efficient for smaller statements compared to STARKs.
STARKs are better for big statements.

* Specific size and timings here, are for common functions seen in practice.
