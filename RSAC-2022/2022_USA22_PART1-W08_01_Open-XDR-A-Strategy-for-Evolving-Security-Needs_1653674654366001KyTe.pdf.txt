So, what is XDR?
XDR
Detection | Incident response | Automation

Network Endpoints

Cloud Third-party data

#RSAC
XDR is a new approach to detection and response.
5

#RSAC
What is driving the need for XDR?
Security teams are drowning from defense in depth

Disparate security point products

Overwhelming number of alerts

Difficulty in conducting investigations
6

#RSAC
How an XDR solution can help reduce risks

Business
Increase efficiency with scalable, flexible, and
existing solutions

#RSAC
The need for deep integrations

Basic integrations
 Translate raw log data into normalized events for analysis

Deep integrations
 Translate raw log data into normalized events for analysis
 Collect and enrich log data  Perform threat analysis  Coordinate response actions  Provide security orchestration  Access to built-in dashboards
