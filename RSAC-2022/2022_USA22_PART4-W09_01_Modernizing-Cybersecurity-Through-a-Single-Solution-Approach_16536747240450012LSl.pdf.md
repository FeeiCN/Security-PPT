Navigating Security Threats and Data Challenges
1. What is Ransomware 2. Data Awareness 3. Reducing the Threat & Risk of Ransomware 4. Collaborative & Consolidated Approach 5. Continuous Compliance

#RSAC
What is Ransomware
Ransomware is malware that employs encryption to hold information at ransom.

#RSAC
How It Works

#RSAC
Kaseya
 Attackers spread the ransomware via a supply
chain infection. They leveraged IT firm Kaseya's VSA software in order to fraudulently push malicious updates to the company's clients.
 Kaseya is known for providing basic software
tools to enterprises that want to handle their own technology configurations. With over 40,000 clients and MSP customers, as many as 1,500 organizations are believed to have experienced network encryption due to this attack.
 Brand impact

#RSAC
Colonial Pipeline
 A single password was used to breach the
network
 Entire pipeline was shut down for the first time
in over 57 years of continuous operation
 Colonial paid attackers $4 - 5 million in ransom
for a decryption tool that was found to be so slow they recovered from their own backups instead

#RSAC
Data Awareness: You Can't Manage What You Can't See
Why leveraging data discovery is a key part of enabling a data protection strategy

Data Protection Platforms

#RSAC
Data Protection Platforms help minimize risks and reduce costs by allowing organizations to automatically discover, remediate, and protect personal and proprietary enterprise data, be it in structured, unstructured, semi-structured or free-form data formats, regardless of device or environment

Know Your Data No Matter Where It Lives for Minimal Risk, and Maximum Value

On Premises, Cloud, Hybrid
Multiple Types of Data, Repositories, Apps
Structured, Unstructured, Semi-structured Data
Dispersed Data of Single Individual

Copying, Sharing
Risky Concentrations of Personal Data
Risky Combinations of Personal Data
Known and Unknown Data and Repositories

Religion + Zip + Age

#RSAC

#RSAC
Ultra-Efficient Data Discovery

Operate across multiple platforms, from on premises to cloud, from structured to unstructured data

Incorporate AI and ML technologies

Reliably scan data at scale

Control false-positive and falsenegative rates

#RSAC
Reducing the Threat and Risk of Ransomware
Poisoning the Well

#RSAC
Ability to "Poison the well"
 Encryption where it matters  Mask data to create false sets of data  Be aware of what data is where so you
fully understand what's at stake

#RSAC
Increased Security
 Automation based on accurate Discovery ensures data never goes unprotected or unnoticed
 Multiple methods of Protection available  Enhanced integrations with the complete
security stack  Business workflow integration to allow
easier collaboration across teams

#RSAC
Alerting
 Be alerted when Data becomes unreadable or encrypted
 Automated task created in workflow systems like ServiceNow
 Have insights into what may have been attacked or ransomed to make informed decisions

#RSAC
Collaboration & Consolidation: Understanding the Why
A small look into business reasoning

Understanding the Business Purpose
What's the end goal or the reason for gathering data? How was the data gathered? Whose data, is it? Are there any consent or contractual obligations? What Regulatory Factors are there for this data?

#RSAC

#RSAC
Data Protection and Use, Based on Business Intel
Retention Periods Security Control Selection BI & Analytics Marketing Enablement Reporting Audit Assurance

Consolidating Toolsets
Reduce fragmented solutions Lower Staff Overhead Increased Accuracy of Protection Shortened Time to Compliance Increased ROI with a centralized approach Data Discovery, Data Awareness, and Data Protection in a single solution helps with consolidation as well as efficient control of the environment

#RSAC
Continuous Compliance Leveraging Automation
Set up scheduled tasks to ensure your organization remains protected and in control

#RSAC
On Going 3-Step Process

Assess. Identifying sensitive data, taking an inventory of IT assets and business processes, and analyzing them for vulnerabilities.
Remediate. Fixing vulnerabilities and eliminating the storage of sensitive data unless necessary.
Report. Compiling and submitting required reports to the appropriate teams and management

It's a Continuous Process

Remediate

Asses

Report

Solution Overview
Continuous data discovery helps organizations remain aware, in control, and prevent Data Breaches by providing:
 Sensitive Data Discovery, and Boundary Protection
 Protection of Data at Rest in Servers and Endpoints
 Restrictive Sensitive Data Access to Privileged Users

#RSAC

#RSAC
Key Principles for Scaling Data Protection and Reducing Risk
 Be Proactive vs Reactive  Plan at the Enterprise level not the Silo level  Build Data Discovery and Protection in by default  Identify and Protect Data accordingly from end to end
