What is DevSecOps?

#RSAC
Integrating security practices within the DevOps process.
DevSecOps fosters a blameless culture and focused on secure delivery of software.

Understanding and objectives

#RSAC

DevSecOps core principles

" DevSecOps is an approach, a mindset, a combination of culture, process and technology "
" You don't BUY DevSecOps, you DO DevSecOps ! "

Culture
Agile, Lean and Continuous Feedback mindset applied throughout the Software Delivery Factory

Automation
Automate everything, everywhere for speed and reliability, using modern automation tools

Measureme
nt
Monitor everything, everywhere for Continuous Feedbacks, Improvement and Quality Management

Sharing
Share, coach, promote closer collaboration and process alignment between lines of business, development, and IT operations

What does DevSecOps look like?
People & Culture
STRATEGY, GOVERNANCE, RISK & COMPLIANCE ALIGNMENT

#RSAC

LEARNING

#RSAC
Why does this matter?
Security practices must keep up with the agile pace of the cloud era.

Traditional Workload Provisioning

Cloud Workload Provisioning

Longer planning cycles
More infrequent deployment schedules
Large, custom deployments
Mostly manual deployment
Siloed goals and objectives
Separate development & operations teams

More agile approach
Deployments more iteratively as needed
Smaller, more standardized deployments
Highly automated and self-service for speed
Development + Operations to "DevOps"
Align objectives & remove tension between the groups

#RSAC
People & Culture
A successful program starts with the people & culture.
Training & Awareness
Explain & embrace new ways of working
Equip teams & individuals with the right level of ownership & tools

Develop Securely: Plan
A security-first approach

Model the threats with experimentation &
validation. Analyze risks to your system. Plan

So, why DevSecOps?

Reduce Risk & Cost Fix early & bake in DR to reduce cost & risk

Increase Quality Continuous monitoring & scanning

Improve Team Synergy Increased collaboration & productivity

Enhance Visibility Threat Management integration

Meet Compliance Address critical compliance requirements

Accelerate Development Security automation integrated into CI/CD pipeline

Secure, Rapid Innovation Satisfy DevOps and CISO requirements

Things to manage

#RSAC
Asset Management
 Asset Tagging is as important as any other task in the organisation - tagging to right resources to the right owners.
 Maintain the CMDB (Configuration Management Database)
 Define asset onboarding or offboarding process  Periodic review and update CMDB
22

Risk Management
Understand the threat landscape for the organisation and applications Perform threat modelling Automate the threat modelling as a code (TaaC) Document the threat Model Process Risk Acceptance from the relevant stake holders.

#RSAC
23

Identity and Access management (IAM)

#RSAC

Store and manage secrets, tokens, control access with Vault

Regularly Audit Policies attached directly to IAM

Automate security checks on secrets
management

Identification of high-risk users.

Track app-to-app credentials

Audit privileged accounts

Enable Multifactor
authentication (MFA)

#RSAC
Embrace the automation

Vulnerability Management

Perform regular vulnerability assessments
Follow the change management process
Perform rescan to ensure the vulnerability fix

Defining the custom priorities of identified vulnerabilities based on the environment
Test the patches in the test or dev environment

#RSAC
Create a patching plan Apply relevant patches to avoid the breaches
26

#RSAC
Web Applications

Continuous Security for Apps

Threat Model the applications

Keep a check on the source code vulnerabilities

Don't miss on addressing the thirdparty dependencies

Good documentation can address half of the
concerns.

Automate the code commit security check and application testing.

Fail the build only when it's a critical bug till the organization attain the higher maturity model

#RSAC
Empower Dev /Ops to deliver better and faster and secure, instead of blocking.

#RSAC
Governance, Risk and Compliance
 Implementation of configuration changes and policy rules  Automate Compliance to run as a code (CaaC)  Versioning is important to maintain code  Setting up the process on when to fail the build in the pipeline.  Create feedback loops to understand the Risks
29

#RSAC
Monitoring and Logging

1
On-boarding critical log sources (applications, servers, network devices, etc.)

2
Enable required logs (e.g application logs, platform logs, security logs etc.)

3
Building use cases to capture critical activities

4

5

Continuous monitoring of the production environment for exploitation of known/unknown vulnerabilities.

Prepare the response plan to handle the incidents.

Emergency Response
 Documented plan for handling the critical incidents  Agreed RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted and Informed) Matrix  Identify the right stakeholders  Documented escalation matrix  High severity incident creation with the bridge (call) details  Knowing the Disaster Recovery (DR) plan  High Availability (HA) setup for critical assets

#RSAC

#RSAC
Cultural Shift
Top Down Approach
 Let developers lead the way  Organizational transparency  Breaking Down Barriers and Silos
 Teams collaboration and inclusive culture  Build Champions and collaborate them  Speak in executives speak!
