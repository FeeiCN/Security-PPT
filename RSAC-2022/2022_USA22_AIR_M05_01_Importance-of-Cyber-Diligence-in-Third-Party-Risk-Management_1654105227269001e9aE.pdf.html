Key Takeaways
 Take TPRM Seriously. You will never have enough resources to completely address third party risk, but you should understand the risks are real.
 Contextualize Risks for Your Business. Identify which vendors, how they have access, and what they need in order to prioritize security requirements of your full vendor lists.
 Verify Security and Repeat Risk Audits Periodically. Do not rely on hearsay of cyber hygiene of crucial vendors and check on them to ensure continued diligence.
 Ask Questions. For high priority vendors, understand their vulnerability management, asset management, and penetration tests for how they recognize and remediate risk.
 Get Assistance. Use security vendors to assess risk on your most critical vendors using threat intelligence.
