#RSAC
What can be done?
7

#RSAC
Who is signing?
What gaps are present?
1. A significant lack of code signing adoption 1. A lack of credible & trustworthy provenance 1. Key management still a challenge!

#RSAC
Digital Signatures
So what does software signing get us?
9

#RSAC
So what does software signing get us?
Verifies integrity of content (signature cannot be verified if even 1 bit is altered)
10

#RSAC
So what does software signing get us?
Non-repudiation (i.e. entity that possesses the private key can not state that they did not sign the artifact)
11

#RSAC
So what does software signing get us?
Authentication: if a private key is conceptually bound to an identity, the sender of signed messages can be assumed
12

#RSAC
So what does software signing get us?
If signature includes a (third-party signed) timestamp, consumers can have greater assurances of when the artifact was signed
13

#RSAC
So why are we not signing?
16

#RSAC
So why are we not signing!?
Managing security of private keys is difficult and expensive
17

#RSAC
So why are we not signing!?
Handling key rotation and key compromise
18

#RSAC
So why are we not signing!?
Fear of Key compromise
19

#RSAC
So why are we not signing!?
Costs!
20

#RSAC
So why are we not signing!?
Tooling is cumbersome to use and has not been modernised...
21

#RSAC
What if signing and key management were greatly simplified and provided for free to all?

What is sigstore?
 Under the OpenSSF (open source software foundation)
 Provides software signing as a public good service
 Combination of services and clients
 Can be deployed privately / internal network

logs are publically transparent?

 Publicly verifiable  Has my key been used?  Has my OIDC been used?  What is the blast radius of a
key compromise?  Who has signed X digest?
