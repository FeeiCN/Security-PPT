What is Behavioral Engineering?

#RSAC
"People are very subjective and influenced by their current emotions. Their decision-making abilities are strongly affected by a variety of cognitive biases
causing them to behave irrationally without noticing it." - Mind the Product

Robinhood asked...

Live 24/7 phone support requesting a callback in app

How might we securely offer phone support for locked out customers, keep bad actors out, AND preserve our callback model?

But who are you...really?

Something you KNOW
Knowledge Based Authentication

Something you HAVE
Proof of possession Phone number, OTP via
SMS

Something you ARE
e.g. Fingerprint, voice, FaceID, retinal scan

Apply & DIY

#RSAC
What can you do right now?
 Ask what behavioral engineering can do for your security architecture: removing friction  lowering security
 Identify what applications voice can improve or already utilize voice-- talk to your IAM team, IT, product owners, or infosec
 Start small: pick a single use case to test--this will help you identify potential blockers and build a POV faster
 Engage a provider like Pindrop for access to advanced Speaker Authentication APIs
