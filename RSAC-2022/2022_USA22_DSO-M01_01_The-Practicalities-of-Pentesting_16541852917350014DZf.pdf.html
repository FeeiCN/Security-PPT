Why ransomware, 32 years later?
...because it's expensive and kind of inconvenient to take your kid to the dentist

#RSAC
Doing Controls vs. Managing Risk

#RSAC
Risk Management Objectives: Externally Driven
1. Use cybersecurity as a competitive differentiator. 2. Comply with a regulatory requirement, contractual
obligation, or industry standard. 3. Achieve a defensible level of "due care." 4. Achieve a comparable level of cybersecurity to peers and/or
competition.

#RSAC
Risk Management Objectives: Internally Driven
1. Prevent the same cybersecurity problems from happening over and over again.
2. Reduce the probability that malicious attackers can stop critical systems and applications from functioning.
3. Require fixes for security bugs for which well known attacks exist.

"Prioritizing compliance or features over a comprehensive process that increases resistance to attack (and also gives us compliance and better security features) is not the risk management we need."
- Sammy Migues
