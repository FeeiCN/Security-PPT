Priority of the Secure Development Lifecycle

Business Drivers
Brand reputation and future business growth rely on having and providing secure products and services
Technology
Sophisticated hacking tools are being developed and deployed by a wide variety of entities, from individuals to organized groups to nation states

Public (P)

Threats
Attacks are growing in sophistication, with an increased focus on espionage and monetary gain (e.g., ransomware), but occasionally with the simple intent of causing disruption
Compliance Concerns
Government, industry, and customer contracts require security assurances that meet both general and domain-specific regulations

Practice 8: Production-Ready Security

Assessments

A Software PRSA typically involves the following process steps...

Review configuration files, source code, and other relevant documentation (attachments, wikis, etc.)

#RSAC

Investigate the security of the

data in transit and at rest and

identify areas where malicious

actors can exfiltrate data or interrupt the streams

5

4
Conduct platform-specific testing such as fuzzing, sideloading, etc. Validate the use of weak or known passwords or exposed keys

1

Conduct reconnaissance of

systems using various scanning

tools such as nmap.

2 3

This is an iterative process and each step in the process can trigger additional areas of concern and identified vulnerabilities

Develop high-value target list of

vulnerable services, etc. and

conduct further investigation.

This includes OS and packages

system(s) are installed on

PSIRT

Playbooks

#RSAC
Tabletops

Some customer-facing applications are selected as part
of Comcast's bug bounty program (PSIRT), which offers incentives to qualified external
researchers for responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities

Cybersecurity Incident Response Playbooks include up-
to-date roles with 24x7x365 contacts, workflows,
prioritization / scoring / ranking, tracking repositories and working agreements

Public (P)

Tabletop exercises test the efficacy of Incident Response playbooks and ensure all players know their role and how to
respond to an incident

Comcast xCyberScore Core Attributes
xCyberScore product decisions align to a few key attributes based on SDL mission and intended audience

Transparent Action-Oriented

Clear line of sight from scores to the underlying findings in order to build trust and inform teams as to the impact of security work
Calculations and UI elements are based on open findings rather than showing a full history of what was closed

Motivational

Scores improve with any reduction in time to resolve vulnerabilities, rather than cutting off at SLA date

Growth-Minded

Findings are classified according to mapped SDL practice to draw a correlation to practice adoption and growth

Onboarding

Quarterly Cycle

* A "group" is 1-N teams that: 1. Work on related code (usually a product or product line) 2. Share essentially the same development process (Scrum, Kanban, etc.) 3. Share essentially the same toolchain (languages, build, etc.)
When it's a single team, we're looking for every team member to attend, but when it's more than one team, we're looking for representatives from each team to attend.
