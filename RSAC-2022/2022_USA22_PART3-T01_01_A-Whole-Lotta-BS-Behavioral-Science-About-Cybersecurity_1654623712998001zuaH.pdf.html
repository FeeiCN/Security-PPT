Defining Insider Threats

Malicious
An insider who seeks to cause harm

Non-Malicious
An insider who does not seek to cause harm
Negligent
An insider who causes harm through carelessness or inattentiveness

Defining Insider Threats

Malicious

Examples
 Espionage  IP Theft  Unauthorized
Disclosure  Sabotage  Fraud  Workplace Violence

Non-Malicious
An insider who does not seek to cause harm

Negligent
An insider who causes harm through carelessness or inattentiveness

Mistaken
A non-malicious insider who causes harm
through a genuine mistake that cannot be attributed to carelessness

Outsmarted
A non-malicious insider who causes harm
through being reasonably outmaneuvered by an attack or adversary

 Ignoring warnings

 Pressing the incorrect button in a very noisy and stressful environment

 Being phished by a new, advanced phishing attack that has not previously been seen in the wild

Research Problem
Insider Threat, Human Sensors, and Reporting Behavior

#RSAC

Insider threats can cause significant operational,
reputational, and financial harm to government and
industry

Human sensors (e.g., supervisors, colleagues) play a critical role in preventing,
detecting, and mitigating insider threats because of
their ability to report concerning behaviors and
incidents that are not observable by computers or
networks

Research on employee reporting of insider threats or
security incidents has consistently revealed that
underreporting by employees is a continuous
challenge

30

#RSAC
Overarching Experimental Design Considerations
Ecological Validity  For each environment, participants will be exposed to insider threat situations that they are likely to face
in their workplace  The research team will collect data about participants' actual reporting behavior (e.g., Security, Human
Resources)
Experimental Condition Boundaries  The threat situation should be obvious and not ambiguous  Workplace violence or terrorism excluded
Participant Protection  Employees will not be penalized for reporting or not reporting behavior resulting from the exposure
environments
31

#RSAC
Design Overview and Participant Selection
Overview of Experimental Design  Malicious actor (e.g., MITRE researcher) sequentially sends 3 pre-scripted InMail
messages.
 Messages tailored to influence participants to focus on their skillset and expertise  Each InMail incorporated known adversary language and behavior  InMails constructed to increasingly escalate recipient's concern
 MITRE follow-ups with employees for consent and one hour security interview either after receiving three messages or immediately after they report
Participant Selection Methodology  Stratified sample of 300 employees by level (e.g., Levels 2,3,4,5,6)  Random number generator applied to employee identification numbers to
determine which employees would be exposed to the study
To ensure realism, employees were unwitting and thus unable to provide consent in advance of receiving messages
32

LinkedIn InMails

InMail 1 "Introduction and Interest"
 Expressed an interest in the participant's skill and/or access to information at [Company]
 Clearly indicated a foreign nexus: China
 Mentioned generous compensation
 Asked for "confidential conversation"

InMail 2 "Quell Concern"
 Appealed to the participant (time-sensitive; legitimize failure to respond)
 Sought to alleviate any concerns or doubts about the solicitation  No travel  Part-time consulting  Remote
 Emphasized extra income in tough times
 Mentioned [Company's] work on Great Powers Competition and 5G
 Re-emphasized foreign nexus

InMail 3 "Appeal and Influence"
 Appealed to the participant (missed opportunity "I would hate to miss a chance to connect")
 Indicated already being in contact with another employee "I have been engaging with Mr. Williams, a Lead Engineer at [Company], and he has shared valuable presentations" (existing insider threat)
 Re-emphasized payment "You will be privately well compensated for your time and information sharing"
 Re-emphasized foreign nexus

Reporting Findings
Total Number of Employees Approached: 290 Total Number of Employees Interviewed: 244
Participant Types  61 Reporters reported the contact
- 58 Reporters were interviewed for the study and 3 were not interviewed
 92 Non-Reporters confirmed exposure to the messages, but did not report
And...  94 Unaware participants received, but were not exposed to the messages  43 Did not report or respond to request for interview
Reporting Rate: 35% - 39%
34

Employee Responses to Message
6 employees responded directly to the "fake foreign recruiter"
 "Thank you for reaching out. At this I'm only interested in full time staff positions. Also my total compensation package including salary and benefits is 200k. Please let me know if any opportunity arises for which I'd be a fit."
 "I would be happy to meet/chat regarding the above. Kind regards"
 "Hi Brittany - thank you for reaching out. I would be happy to learn more about this role. Please let me know when would be a good time for you to chat."
 "Hi Brittany, I can be reached at xxx-xxx-xxxx. I'm available today around 1 pm, otherwise tied up today and tomorrow. I'm available on the weekend as well."
 "I am unclear what you are seeking. I cannot do work on behalf of [Company] that would be compensated. I am happy to talk with you if you want to set up a call. Thank you"
 "Sarah, Please remove me from your interest list."
5 out of the 150 employees who read the first message opened the door to discussion

Recommendations
Reporting mechanism is not the problem Both groups knew textbook response to reporting, yet their actual behaviors were not consistent with that knowledge Overconfidence in ability to mitigate vulnerabilities
Data indicates a lack of clear understanding of "what risk" to report
Non-reporters do not see themselves as a target
Employees struggle to connect private networks with work risk
Reporters discussed with others more
Non-reporters personally know fewer people who have reported insider threats
Non-reporters are not sufficiently concerned about their mutual friends' networks Embedding Insider Threat and CI training within general security training was not effective for recall

#RSAC
37

#RSAC
What We Didn't Find
 Reporting mechanism is the problem  Concerns with anonymity  Fear of retaliation for reporting  Concerns with causing trouble for other employees  Concerns about not getting feedback from Security
- Reporters indicated expecting follow-up after reporting  Once a reporter, more likely to be a reporter  Employee sensitivity to companies highly competitive strategic priorities
(e.g., 5G, GPC)
38

#RSAC
Recommendations
 If your employees know how to report, focus on WHAT to report.  Provide training and help to employees and their families and friends.  Use security training that includes more grey-area scenarios.  "We're here to help" Humanize the security team.  Be positive, skip the FUD.  Remember COM-B and leverage emotion to motivate (storytelling,
gamification, etc.)  Remember, knowing and doing are not the same thing.
