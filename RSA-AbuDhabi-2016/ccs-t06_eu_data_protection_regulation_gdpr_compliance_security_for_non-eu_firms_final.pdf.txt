True spirit and benefits of GDPR
Positive enhancement of data security
(including other areas, like IP)
Avoids financial losses (data breaches are
costly)
Prevents reputational problems Improves brand image Encourages investors/partners' attitude Reduces illegal data trafficking Customers want mo14re confidentiality and

Provision/ Requirement

What it means for the customer

Definition of personal data

You need to know perfectly your information assets, know exactly what data is personal data, what data is not, be able to segregate it and handle it accordingly. Are personal data: all your HR data, your client/customer data, your prospect/direct marketing/targeted advertising data, and also pretty much all the IT activities of your personnel (emails, browsing history, logs, login credentials, etc).

How to implement (With the help of internal and external resources)
Analyse the complexity of your datasets, the location and the flows of personal data. Select and deploy relevant technology.

General principle of accountability of data controllers

Controllers must take every technical and organizational measure appropriate to ensuring and demonstrating compliance.

Analyse the relevant technical and organizational measures especially around information protection, information security and incident response, track and document the implementation and the effectiveness of your policies.

Principles of Privacy by Design, Privacy by Default

From the very first moment you process personal data, you should make sure you have taken every step to protect privacy and data. This includes adequate riskbased security around any personal data assets and personal data processing operations you have. This is also covered by the notion of "Accountability" (above).

Assess and define what is your IT risk profile and what would be the appropriate security measures for your data assets and processing, so that you can "do the right thing" at all times, i.e. be an accountable data custodian for your employees, customers, consumers, clients, patients, partners, etc.

How security technology can help
The GDPR is a legislation about data protection The GDPR is NOT a legislation about cyber security However, cyber security technology is required in order to be compliant, and can help to achieve compliance, and this is how:
Governance and accountability of policies Implementation of policies, record keeping and reporting Management of identities and authentication Data and infrastructure security (e.g. encryption, data loss prevention) Data breach notification and Incident response Cloud security and cloud management
19

"Apply" Slide
Next week you should:
Assess whether GDPR applies to your organization:
Do you process personal data of EU Residents?
In the first three months following this presentation you should:
If so, identify and select legal, consulting and technological partners Understand what personal data you process, know where it is and how it flows in the organisation (with an eye to the supply chain ecosystem) Understand what business or internal processes are involved in the Governance of Personal Data Identify relevant stakeholders Review your information risk management
Within six months you should:
Put in place detection and response planning Select security technology that can map and protect personal data, and drive the compliance journey Ensure you can demonstrate data protection and mitigations features
