Conditions
 Web cache functionality is set for the web application to cache static files based on their extensions, disregarding any caching header.
 When accessing a page like http://www.example.com/home.php/nonexistent.css, the web server will return the content of home.php for that URL.
 Victim has to be authenticated while accessing the triggering URL.
