Unified Security:
Improving the Future
As a community of incident response and security teams, we are continually bombarded by events that keep us focused on the immediate needs of our constituency and not their future needs. We should be enabling business, not delaying it. We should be a discriminator in brand selection, not just a cost center. We know the landscape. We have the responsibility of improving security for our constituents.
When we gather in Berlin for the annual conference, I ask that we focus our collective efforts on improving the future of security together. Let's share our ideas, our projects and our successes. Let's build on those successes and find new ways to transform the relationship with our constituents to that of an enabler, moving from the reactive to the proactive.
Join us for the 27th Annual FIRST Conference, 14-19 June 2015 in the great city of Berlin--a city rich in history and no stranger to breaking down walls--as we take strides towards breaking down our own barriers and unifying security for our global constituency.

ABOUT FIRST.ORG
The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams is an international not-for-profit organization bringing together a variety of security and incident response teams. Today, FIRST is comprised of 300 member teams from over 60 countries representing government agencies, academia, commercial enterprises, and financial corporations. FIRST is a front-line enabler in the global response community, providing access to best practices, tools, and trusted communication with its member teams. FIRST seeks to:
 Facilitate better communication and information
sharing among teams and the global community at large
 Foster cooperation and coordination in incident
prevention
 Provide prompt rapid reaction to incidents
Writing about FIRST, the leading British commentator David Lacey declared in Computer Weekly:
"Of all the security clubs and associations, the one that impresses me most is FIRST http://www.first.org, the Forum for Incident Response and Security Teams. Why? Because it's focused, born out of real business requirements and it's highly selective, i.e. you have to be sponsored and audited to gain membership. FIRST is not a club that exists to make an income for its organizers. It's an international community that serves a real purpose: helping Government, Industry and Academia to respond quickly and effectively to new security threats. So I have no hesitation in recommending that you book a space in your busy diary to attend their Annual Conference."
