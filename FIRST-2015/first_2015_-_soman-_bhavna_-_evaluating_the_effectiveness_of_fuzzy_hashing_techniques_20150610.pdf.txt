WHAT ADVANTAGE CAN KNOWING THE ORIGINS OF A MALICIOUS BINARY GIVE YOU??
 We can apply past analyses of motivations and capabilities of adversary
 Connect disparate events into one whole picture  So what's the best way to connect the dots?

AGENDA
 Methods to connect binaries  Getting a test dataset and
ground truth  Results  Sample clusters found  Takeaways and Future
direction

WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO CONNECT SIMILAR BINARIES??
 Imphash-- md5 hash of the import table
 ssdeep-- Context triggered piecewise hashing
 SDhash-- Bloom filters
How to :
1. Get non-trivial dataset of binaries related to targeted campaigns
2. Establish ground truth without static/dynamic analyses of hundreds of binaries?

 No one method found all the correlations
 Imphash had the most false positives
 Sdhash had maximum recall
 Both ssdeep and SDhash had near perfect precision

IMPHASH

IMPHASH
 Version 1.5 of ComRAT (Turla Attackers)
 Compiled on March 25, 2008  Other versions of the RAT in the
dataset were not connected

 Wipbot 2013 Samples  Used by the Waterbug
attack Group  Compiled on 15-10-2013  Also referred to as Tavdig/
WorldCupSec/Tadj Makhal

 SAV samples circa 2011  Used by the Waterbug
Attack group  AKA Turla/Uruboros

IMPHASH

IMPHASH
 Both samples of ComRAT  Associated with Waterbug Group
and Turla Attackers respectively
 Samples of the Carbon Malware  Related to Project Cobra and The
Waterbug Attack Group

IMPHASH

IMPHASH
 Binaries from SIX different campaigns
 No common Actor or Malware Family
 Different parts of the Kill chain
 Credential stealer and dropper from OP Arid Viper
 Vs. Droppers used by Attacks on the Syrian Opposition Forces
 No common attribution or KNOWN link

SDHASH

SDHASH
 SAV/Uruboros samples  30 different Binaries compiled
over 3 months in 2013
 Correlation between Dropper, Stage 1, Stage 2 and Injected Library of Cobra Campaign
 High similarity with Carbon Tool used by the Waterbug group
 Widely varying AV labels even controlling for vendor  Correlations made by sdhash only

SDHASH

SDHASH
 Backdoor used by OP Desert Falcon  Vs. Scanbox sample (known to be related
to Anthem attacks and Deep Panda)  No known relationship between those
actors/campaigns/malware families
 "HttpBrowser"malware used in Anthem attack
 "AmmyAdmin" tool used by the Carbanak group

SDHASH

WHAT NEXT?
 Imphash, ssdeep, SDhash-- which is best?
 It pays to know your adversary
 APT binaries may share code within campaign and actor-- Code similarity can be used to connect binaries from the same source.
 Connections can help make strategic decision to respond to an adversary, NOT infection.

ACKS/Q&A/THANKS!
 Chris Kitto and Jeff Boerio for helping me make better slides.
 Wonderful folks that write Security white papers
 @kbandla for creating and maintaining APTNotes
 Virus Total for the great data they provide
