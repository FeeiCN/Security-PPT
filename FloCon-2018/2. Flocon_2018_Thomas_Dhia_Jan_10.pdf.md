 Overall  Goals:
 Investigate  the  relationship  between  CommonNames  found  on  x509   certificates  and  Zbot  FF  domains
 Does  Zbot  FF's  use  of  SSL  `leak  information'?

Objectives
 Provide  a  series  of  simple  statistical  methods  that  allow  a  researcher   to  identify  ZBot  FF  domains  using  SSL  data
 More  generally,  provide  a  pipeline  to  analyze  a  large  data  set  from  a   macro  and  micro  view  perspective  to  detect  patterns
 All  of  the  data  discussed  is  open  source  and  can  be  obtained  at  scans.io/study/sonar.ssl  Thanks  to  rapid7  and  the  University  of  Michigan

Graphs  as  Representation
 SSL  data  naturally  fits  into  a  bipartite  graph
 A  bipartite  graph  is  a  graph  whose  vertices  can  be   split  into  two  disjoint  sets
 Mapping  could  have  been  done  differently:
텶P  range  instead  of  ASN 텮SN  gave  the  best  resolution  to  examine  the  data
11

Bipartite  Graph  -- Investigation
 Anomalous  behavior  requires  baseline  metrics  of  normal  Create  a  measure  of  popularity  for  each  CommonName
Requirements:  Have  it  based  on  topological  features  of  the  bipartite  graph  Calculate  frequencies  of  what  type  of  ASNs  host  each  CommonName  Type  of  ASN  refers  to  the  popularity  of  the  ASN  Popularity  of  an  ASN  is  defined  by  how  many  CommonNames  are   hosted  on  it  
12

Graph  Analytics  -- ASNs

 Examine  the  degree  distributions  for   both  sets  of  the  bipartite  graph

ASN  degree

 ASNs  with  degree  1:  2  ASNs  with  degree  2:  3  ASNs  with  degree  3:  2

Graph  Analytics  -- ASNs
 Sampled  histogram  shows  popularity   frequency  of  the  22,682  ASNs  in  the   January  SSL  dataset  from  a  new  sample   set  of  5k
 Long  tailed
 There  exists  at  least  one  ASN  that  hosts   more  than  50,000  unique  CommonNames
 Majority  of  mass  concentrated  in  the  range   of  ASNs  hosting  between  1  and  100  domains

Graph  Analytics  -- Domains

 Examine  the  degree  distributions  for   both  sets  of  the  bipartite  graph

Graph  Analytics  -- Domains
 First  histogram  displays  a  sampling  from  the   set  of  850,236  domains  and  their   corresponding  distribution
 The  tick  marks  show  the  outliers  at  the  tail
 Majority  of  the  domains  are  hosted  on  (map   to)  1--200  ASNs
 This  is  visually  apparent  by  zooming  into  a   sampled  region  of  the  the  range  1--140
16

Graph  Analytics  -- Domains
17

Graph  Analytics  -- Domains
 As  we  move  towards  the  right  of  the  graph  we   `gain'  more  information  about  the  domain
 Information  regarding  how  popular  it  is
 Goal  is  to  identify  structures  within  the  graph.
 Structure  requires  some  measure  of  information

low information increase in useful information
18

Graph  Analytics  -- Domains
 831,704  domains  map  to  only  a  single  ASN
 translates  to  around  97%  of  all  domains  fall  in  that  band
 99%  of  domains  map  to  the  range  between  1--10
 1--10  too  sparse    not  enough  information

low information increase in useful information
19

Graph  Analytics  -- Domains
 Inspecting  the  histogram  helps  us  determine  an   easy  high  pass  filter
 Use  the  mass  density  of  the  histogram  in  relation  to   information  gain
 Examine  domains  that  map  to  only  10  or  more  ASNs
 Analogous  to  a  document  containing  only  one  word  Allows  us  to  remove  around  99%  of  domains

Individual  Domain  Analysis

 Taken  the  macro  approach  so  far
 Examined  domain  and  ASN  distribution
New  Goal:  Examine  the  ASN  distribution  of  two   individual  domains
 Histogram  shows  frequency  of  different types  of  ASN  that  hosts  a  cert  for  the   given  domain
 X--axis  denotes  the  type  of  ASN  Y--Axis  frequency

moderately populated ASNs
lowly populated ASNs

highly populated ASN
22

Individual  Domain  Analysis
 Noticeable  differences  between  the   two  domains
 naranyamarket.com is  found  on   some  extremely  populated  ASNs
 One  ASN  that  hosts  ~  25k  domains
 meenyousecu.com max  ASN  hosts  ~   1.8k  domains
 For  meenyousecu.com  -- majority  of   ASNs  host  less  than  108  unique  CNs
23

Filter  Design
 You  cannot  directly  compare  histograms  Need  to  be  compared  on  the  same  scale
 Devise  a  bucketing  scheme  that  is  sensitive  to  `low  popularity'  ASNs
 Increase  the  number  of  bands  in  the  lower  frequency  spectrum  lower  frequency  spectrum  refers  to  ASNs  that  map  to  <50  domains
 Intuition  is  based  on  the  original  distribution  of  ASN  frequency  counts
 Interested  in  domains  that  are  found  on  many  ASNs  where  those  ASNs  are  not   highly  popular
 Majority  of  the  domains  hosted  on  1--200  ASNs
24

Filter  Design  
 Bucket  the  frequencies  into  9  different  bands.
 1--5  6--10  11--20  21--50  etc  Distance  between  the  bands  increase  as  we  increase  
the  ASN  popularity
 Lower  frequencies  provide  higher  resolution  The  bucketing  process  transforms  the  distribution  
of  ASN  popularity  counts  into  a  9--d  vector
25

Filter  Design  -- Histograms  to  Vectors
Different  bands  are:  [1--5],  [6--10],  [11,20],  [21,50],  etc

Anomaly  Detection  per  ASN  Count  Band
 Refocus  on  CNs  and  how  many  ASNs  each   domain  maps  to
27

Anomaly  Detection  per  ASN  Count  Band

 Filter  out  the  outliers  (dlink,  google,  etc)
 Bucket  domains  that  are  mapped  to  roughly   the  same  number  of  ASNs  together
 e.g.  [160--150]    [itunes.apple.com,  image--
glb.qpyou.cn,  asos--media.com,  etc.]
 For  a  given  count  band,  e.g.  [160--150] calculate  the  pairwise  Euclidean  distance   between  two  domains  using  the  domain's   histogram  vector

 Each  column  gives  us  the  distance   d1

d(d1, d2) d(d1,d3)

between  a  domain  and  every   other  domain  in  that  band

d2 d(d2, d1) 0

d(d2, d3)

 i.e.  red    all  the  distances  from  d1

29

Anomaly  Detection  per  Frequency  Band

 Calculate  the  Euclidean  norm  (EN)  per   column  to  determine  the  similarity  of   each  domain  to  others

 Ran  this  algorithm  over  the  Jan  dataset.
 Returned  one  interesting  case  in  the  band

Anomaly  Detection  per  Frequency  Band
 The  histogram  clearly  shows  a   significant  outlier  (more  than  2  std   away)
 The  outlier  in  the  high  band  was   `tangerine--secure.com' which  we   verified  as  a  ZBot  Fast  flux  domain
Average
Outliers of interest
31

Anomaly  Detection  per  Frequency  Band
 Another  interesting  band  is  the   30--40  ASN  popularity  range
 The  distance  spectrum  is  tighter   than  the  100--110  range
 The  tail  end  of  the  histogram   contains  interesting  domains
32

Anomaly  Detection  -- Results
 Out  of  these  5  domains  -- three  are   ZBot  fast  flux  (meenyousecu.com,   securedatassl.net,   secure.tangerineaccess.com')
 Confirmed  TPs  via  PDNS  and  active   probing  (of  SSL  certs)
 Removed  FPs  with  additional  signals  This  anomaly  detection  method  was  
able  to  reduce  ~800k  domains  down  to   a  manageable  list  of  8  domains
33

Validating  TPs  and  Removing  FPs
 Further  signals  were  incorporated  to  help   delineate  between  outliers
 Examine  the  number  of  unique  SHAs   associated  with  a  particular  commonName
 Examine  ASN  count  over  IP  count  ratio  ZBot  FF  is  bounded  by  the  number  of  IPs   the  actor  provisions  to  client  domains  For  ZBot  FF,  on  average  a  client  domain   gets  1  IP  per  ASN
 Gave  us  actionable  intelligence  regarding   which  ASNs  to  monitor  more  closely

Takeaways
 Global  structure  of  SSL  graph  can  inform  local  behavior  of  SSL  graph
 We  can  use  the  macro  knowledge  to  help  us  create  similarity  measures  for  each   micro  layer
 We  can  use  this  statistical  method  as  a  mechanism  to  cluster  anomalous   domains  in  the  graph
 We  can  reduce  the  set  of  domains  of  interest  from  ~800k    8
