Capabilities 1/2
 Measurements
 Network statistics (load, packets dropped, retransmitted)  Usage statistics (countries, organizations, ISPs)  Diagnostics (jitter, packet size, hops, delay)
 Visualizations
 Critical activity gauges  Overlaid advanced metrics  Connections graphs of top users

Plug-in: Tensor Analysis 1/3
 Tensor: multidimensional matrix of real numbers  Each mode is n-dimensional matrix (called slice)

01/10/2017

22

Plug-in: Tensor Analysis 2/3
 Tensor energy
 Average sum of squares per slice given mode

 Data sparsification
 Low energy change data discarded during update

 Event detection
 High energy change data indicates new trend that may warrant investigation (anomalous behavior?)
