Who am I
 ID:0xr0ot(not 0xroot)  Security researcher(2
years)  Mainly focus on
Android security  Always like basketball

Agenda
 drozer introduction  Binder fuzz model  Case share  How to exploit

Drozer Architecture
 console  agent  server

Functionality

 Exploit  Scanner

Metasploit?

Design Principles
 Reflection  Class loading

Drozer mode
 direct mode  infrastructure mode

Commands
drozer server start --port port drozer exploit build exploit.usb.socialengineering.usbdebugging --server ip -credentials username password drozer console connect --server ip:port --password

Writing a module

Binder fuzz
Why use drozer? I am familiar with it,XD!
 fuzz intent  fuzz service call

Fuzz model
 drozer module(core)  external python script(control logic)
All in the one drozer module is OK

Case Share
 LockScreen bypass(or clear)  Fake shutdown (eavesdropping)  Capability leak  System Dos

LockScreen bypass(CVE-2016-3749)

CVE-2016-3749 Details

Windfall

CVE-2016-3749 Patch

My first high severity issue

Fake Shutdown(eavesdropping)
 Samsung

Capability Leak
 nexus series car mode  samsung change theme Video demonstration

System Dos(restart)
 nexus(3) Video demonstration.  samsung(11)

How to exploit(system service vulnerability)
 use AIDL file  use java reflection  native layer  shell script

Exploit-use AIDL file
 The Android SDK tools will help to generate an interface in the Java programming language, based on the .aidl file you import.
 "The ***.aidl file not found",but it's just there.If the similar error occurs,you can write the java code manually.
Reference: Android Bound Service(by ) http://drops.wooyun.org/mobile/13676

Exploit-use AIDL file

Exploit-use reflection
 The nature is the same as use AIDL file.  It doesn't need .AIDL file.

Exploit-native

Exploit-shell script
 clear.sh  key code:
Runtime runtime = Runtime.getRuntime(); Process proc = runtime.exec(command);

Summary
 AIDL:It is easy to see the nature of the vulnerability.
 java reflection: It is simple and convenient.  native:It needs android source environment.  shell script:It is simple.
