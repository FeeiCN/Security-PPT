SUMMARY
Why we do Our destination Our concerns What we done What we will do

Why we do
The reason is quite simple:
 great project comes from coincidence  cloud computing can make money  blank space of internal market  we have technical advantage

What is differences between SAE & VPS:
 focus on web developer VS no special user  service user VS device tenant  entire distributed web solution VS only basic service  strong SLA VS week SLA  pay for usage VS prepayment
