Preliminary
 What is biometric authentication?
 Biometric Feature
 Face, Voice, Fingerprint, Iris, Palmprint etc.
 Areas of applications
 Device unlock  Password recover  App login  Real-name authentication
 A typical biometric authentication process

Preliminary
 What is liveness detection?
 Definition
Verify if the biometric being captured is an actual measurement from the authorized live person
 Existed methodology
 Imitative medium recognition
texture analysis, optical flow, playback reverberation, etc.
 Interactive action check
nod / shake head, open mouth, blink, speak words, etc.
 Specific Hardware
Face ID, ToF, NIR, etc.

Preliminary
 What is Face ID attention detection ?
Face ID confirms attention by detecting the direction of your gaze, then uses neural networks for matching and anti-spoofing so you can unlock your phone with a glance

Previous Studies

 Previous studies mainly focused on how to generate fake video/audio, but bypassing the liveness detection algorithm is necessary in the real attack

 Bypassing Face ID by 3D mask requires victim's 3D info and is proven hard to reproduce

 Preliminary and Previous Studies  Hardware-level Video/Audio Injection  Insecure Recognition Scene Exploiting  Mitigation  Conclusion

Why do hardware-level video/audio injection?
 Avoid information loss during biometric secondary acquisition and playback
 HSL space color loss  focus blur  playback reverberation effect
 Hide the attack medium characteristics
 Texture  optical flow  frequency response distortion
 Be completely software-insensitive
 Against emulators detection  Against anti-hook

Video/Audio Injection Requirements
 Low Latency
 Excessive delay will cause recognition failure
 Good Compatibility
 Compatible with different Apps like native sensor
 Real Time Fake Data Import
 Fake videos/audio stream can be generated and imported in real time
 Transparent
 Can't easily be recognized by emulators detection or anti-hook

Video Injection Example
 Using Toshiba TC358749XBG chip to make a hardware module that can converts HDMI stream to MIPI CSI stream
 Connecting the above module to an Android development board (RK3399) to form a complete video injection attack device
 Using the above device, we can disguise the HDMI output of a PC as a video stream captured by native camera
nod head, shake head, open mouth, blink ...

Video Injection Example

Audio Injection Example
 Most voiceprint authentication systems accept authorized voice from the microphone cable
 Create a hardware module that converts the audio stream into a microphone stream
 Convert the audio stream from the sound card of PC into microphone stream and directly inject malicious voice into the authentication device

What if attacker can't physically contact the victim's equipment?

Why do device fingerprint spoofing ?
 Biometric authentication is disabled on a new device by default
 Binding account with device fingerprint
 IMEI, MAC address, Android ID, etc.  Customized ID based hardware info
 Device Fingerprint Spoofing
 Step1: Reverse engineering on the algorithm of customized device fingerprint  Step2: Steal device info from victim's device(eg. install a malicious app)  Step3: Cheat the server that we are using biometric authentication on an authorized
device

Threat Model
 Device fingerprint spoofing to enable biometric authentication  Hardware-level Injection to bypass liveness detection

Device fingerprint spoofing

Steal device fingerprint Generate fake video/audio

Hardware-level Injection

App Login Password Recover

Steal victim's headshot/recording

 Preliminary and Previous Studies  Hardware-level Video/Audio Injection  Insecure Recognition Scene Exploiting  Mitigation  Conclusion

Why do insecure recognition scene exploiting

Tradeoff between user experience and security under specific scenes

 Weak light environment (Facial)

 Sunshine environment (Facial)

 Glasses scene (Facial)

 Noisy environment (Voice)

 Accents and dialects scene (Voice)  Unsharp fingerprint (Fingerprint) ...

User Experience

Security

Attacker can induce liveness detection algorithm to walk into an insecure branch by creating above specific scene!

A case of insecure recognition scene exploiting
A funny scenario from the hit CTF-themed TV series "Go Go Squid!"

How to bypass the attention detection mechanism of Face ID ?
Challenges:  Can't wake up the sleeping victim  3D eyes are difficult to forge  Low cost & high success rate
Preliminary ideas:  Try to touch the victim as little as possible  Find ways to replace 3D eyes with 2D eyes  Try to simulate the state of eyes looking directly at phone

We found the following facts:

 Face ID allows users to unlock while wearing glasses
 Face ID no longer extract 3D info from the eye area when recognized glasses
 The abstraction of the eye is a black area with a white point in the center in the glasses scene

vulnerable branch

Identity glasses?

No

Yes

Match 3D eyes

Match 2D eyes

In the dark environment, the abstraction of the eye is a black area with a white point in the center

When unlocking phone, eyes must looks forward so the white spot is in the center of the black area

The Prototype of "X-glasses"

Features:  Low cost  High success rate  Practical  Less than two minutes  Suitable for any victim

 Preliminary and Previous Studies  Hardware-level Video/Audio Injection  Insecure Recognition Scene Exploiting  Mitigation  Conclusion

Mitigation: for hardware-layer injection & device ID spoofing
 Add identity authentication for native camera  Forbidden to accept authenticated voice from the microphone cable  Increase the weight of video/audio synthesis detection  Design a device binding mechanism to against device fingerprint spoofing

Mitigation: for X-glasses attack
Step 1:Texture Analysis for 2D picture

Texture Classifier
Accept

Reject FAIL

Step 2:Depth Analysis for 3D info

Depth Distinguish
Depth Comparison

PASS

Combine texture features with depth information to against X-glasses attack

 Preliminary and Previous Studies  Hardware-level Video/Audio Injection  Insecure Recognition Scene Exploiting  Mitigation  Conclusion

Conclusion
 We proposed a universal methodology for bypassing liveness detection
 Injecting fake video/audio stream by evil hardware to hide attack media  Creating specific recognition scene to trigger the defect of liveness detection algorithm
 We found a new threat to app login or password recovery based on biometric authentication by hardware-level injection and device fingerprint spoofing
 We reversed the attention detection mechanism of Face ID and bypass it with X-glasses at ultra-low cost and high success rate
