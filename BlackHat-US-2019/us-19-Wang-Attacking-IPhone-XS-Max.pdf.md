Unix Domain Socket
 A UNIX socket is an inter-process communication mechanism that allows
bidirectional data exchange between processes running on the same machine.

int sock; struct sockaddr_un name; char buf[1024]; /* Create socket from which to read. */ sock = socket(AF_UNIX, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);
/* Create name. */ name.sun_family = AF_UNIX; strcpy(name.sun_path, "1.txt"); name.sun_len = strlen(name.sun_path);
/* Bind socket to the path. */ bind(sock, (struct sockaddr *)&name,
SUN_LEN(&name));
/* Read from the socket. */ read(sock, buf, 1024);
close(sock);

int sock; struct sockaddr_un name; char buf[1024]; /* Create socket from which to write. */ sock = socket(AF_UNIX, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);

/* Connect the socket to the path. */ connect(sock, (struct sockaddr *)&name,
SUN_LEN(&name));
/* Write to the socket. */ write(sock, buf, 1024);

The race condition bug results in a UAF

The fix
 Fixed in iOS 12.2
 Still raceable, but adding extra checks to make sure two vnodes will only
keep one reference to the socket
 No public CVE
if(unp->unp_vnode==NULL){ vp->v_socket = unp->unp_socket; unp->unp_vnode = vp;
}

The pattern
 More and more bugs caused by temporary unlocks were discovered,
implying an important bug pattern

So far so good. Can we win the game without a fight with PAC?
Userspace

Got troubles while adding trust caches
 With tfp0, adding trust caches is quit straightforward on old devices
 by adding adhoc hashes, we can avoid code signature validations on our
executables
 But on A12 devices, we got a new type panic when adding hashes
panic(cpu 3 caller 0xfffffff013cb2880): \"pmap_enter_options_internal: page locked down, \" \"pmap=0xfffffff013cd40a0, v=0xffffffe04a27c000, pn=2108823, prot=0x3, fault_type=0x3, flags=0x0, wired=1, options=0x9\"
 Apparently, there are other mitigations

__PPLTEXT
 Contains code for  Pmap related functions  Code signature related functions  Trust cache related functions ...
 Code in __PPLTEXT cannot be executed unless a special register ("#4, c15,
c2, #1) is set to 0x4455445564666677

__PPLTRAMP

Let's check this jopdetector
jop detector is supposed to check the integrity of the saved thread context

Let's check this jopdetector
But wait, a mismatch of hash values does not lead to a panic because of an early return

What can we do
 Make a thread trapping into the kernel and waiting for return (e.g.,
waiting for a mach msg)
 Change the saved thread context (ELR_EL1 and SPSR_EL1) based on
tfp0
 Make the thread return (e.g., sending a msg)  Gain arbitrary code execution in the kernel via eret  Call ppl_ loadTrustCache (0x25) to load our own dynamic trust cache
