This talk is based on
Windows 10 1803 / 1809 Vulnerabilities repTorted to MSRC
Visual Studio 2017 Vulnerabilities reported to MSRC

Introduction
What's new in this talk

Case study
Learn from historical bugs

Silver bullet
Where / how can I find bugs

Automatic
Build the discovery framework

Findings
bugs found by framework

Introduction : privilege escalation bugs in system service

System services (RPC , COM , ...)

system user token

Call

Restricted user

File / Registry / Handler operation

Introduction : file privilege escalation bugs

System services Create / Detele / Write (RPC , COM , ...) Grant Acess / Set Owner

Introduction : file privilege escalation bugs in RPC service

Introduction : file privilege escalation bugs in RPC service

Protocol Restricted user
Sequences

RPC services

Ncalrpc (ALPC)

ncacn_np ncacn_ip_tcp ncacn_ip_udp ncacn_http

Introduction : Analyze ALPC interface
RPC viewer
IDA pro Process Monitor

Introduction : Analyze ALPC interface

Introduction : What's new
100+ interfaces , 1000+ functions ( only in ALPC ) Too many to be analyzed Fuzzer is designed to find memory corruption bugs , not logical flaw.

Introduction : What's new
Focus on the "Low-hanging-fruits" Easy to find , Easy to exploit
Automated if possible
What does those fruits look like ?

Case Study #1 : DACL rewrite (CVE-2018-8440)
Task Scheduler Service ALPC schedsvc.dll SchRpcSetSecurity
Grant Access to .job file

Case Study #1 : DACL rewrite (CVE-2018-8440)

Case Study #1 : DACL rewrite (CVE-2018-8440)

Case Study #1 : DACL rewrite (CVE-2018-8440)

Case Study #1 : DACL rewrite (CVE-2018-8440)
SetSecurity::RpcServer
ConvertStringSecurityDescriptorToSecurityDescriptor TaskPathCanonicalize
JobSecurity::Update
JobSecurity::AddRemovePrincipalAce

Case Study #1 : DACL rewrite (CVE-2018-8440)
create a hardlink named xxx.job point it to C:\windows\win.ini call the SchRpcSetSecurity Done
Easy to find , Easy to exploit "low-hanging fruits" !

Case Study #2 : TOCTOU Readfile (CVE-2019-0636)
Installer Service
MsiAdvertiseProduct
enables the installer to write to a script the registry and shortcut

Case Study #2 : TOCTOU Readfile (CVE-2019-0636)

Case Study #2 : TOCTOU Readfile (CVE-2019-0636)

Impersonate Check Access SzPackagePath

Revert to System Copy
SzPackagePath =>
c:\windows\installer

The copy is readable for current user

Case Study #2 : TOCTOU Readfile (CVE-2019-0636)
Battle with TOC-TOU
Oplocks Based on DeviceIoControl function define Callback function win TOCTOU in 1 time
ReadDirectoryChangesW No lock Brute force is needed

Case Study #2 : TOCTOU Readfile (CVE-2019-0636)

Silver bullet: how to find new bugs
 Analyze ALPC interface related to impersonation Not only ALPC interface but also documented function related to system service they make mistakes here again and then again
 Something new ...

Silver bullet: Analyze ALPC interface  impersonation
 Export ALPC interface from RPC viewer Function related to impersonate file operation
 Collet function list from MSDN Function related to system service

Bug #0
Program Compatibility Assistant Service ALPC pcasvc.dll RAiGetFileInfoFromPath
get metadata from path

Bug #0

Bug #0
Only use Impersonate
to check access

Do operation as system

Same mistake
Case #2

Bug #0

Silver bullet: Analyze ALPC interface  impersonation
But this is not the bullet we want
 Hard to Automated too many & reverse engineering is real hard  Low-hanging-fruits were sold out

Silver bullet: how to find new bugs
 Analyze ALPC interface related to impersonation Not only ALPC interface but also documented function related to system service they make mistakes here again and then again
 Something new

Silver bullet: Trigger function call with UI interaction
How to trigger function call without reverse engineering

Build automated framework
Template for DACL rewrite bugs
Do random UI interaction ( Click , Press button )

start application from system apps list

Hook process monitor to detect "SetSecurity" Call

Try to replace the path with symlink or hardlink ,
test if DACL changed
Save the log

Build automated framework : target
1. Windows 10 apps Camera / Xbox live .....
2. System application Network manager / Windows defender ...
3. Microsoft product Office / Visual Studio ...

Build automated framework : UI interaction
Mouse : get handler of target's window click button / menu list
Keyboard : press "enter" / some other keys

Bug #1
AppX Deployment Service Simple "Click" to trigger Set DACL for settings file
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Packages\<Packagename>

Bug #1
Replace settings file with hardlink

Run windows
app

Get full control of
any file

Bug #1

Bug #1

Bug #2
Diagnostics Hub Standard Collector Service "Click button from menu" to trigger Create X-X-X-X-X.scratch file
Set DACL for X-X-X-X-X file with same name

Bug #2

Bug #2

Bug #3
Windows defender service "Click button from right click menu" to trigger Quarantine "Current threats"
Set DACL for virus file

Bug #3

Bug #3

Bug #3
