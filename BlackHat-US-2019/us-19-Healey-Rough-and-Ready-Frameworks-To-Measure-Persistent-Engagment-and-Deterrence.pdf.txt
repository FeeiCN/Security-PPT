UNDERSTANDING PERSISTENT ENGAGEMENT AND DETERRENCE

National Security Advisor John Bolton
Intent of Administration on Cyber Deterrence
We have authorized offensive cyber operations [...] not because we want more
offensive operations in cyberspace, but precisely to create the structures of deterrence that will demonstrate to
adversaries that the cost of their engaging in operations against us is higher than they want to bear
The hacking of [OPM] by China ... that's the kind of threat to privacy from hostile foreign
actors that we're determined to deter

"... A good offense is critical and that is the best defense. "...If [adversaries] know that we have incredible offensive capability, then that should deter them from conducting attacks on us in cyber"
https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/19-58_07-11-19.pdf

New CJCS Sums It Up

But Not Just Possession But Use of Cyber Capabilities
"Unlike the nuclear realm ... in cyberspace it's the use of cyber capabilities that is strategically consequential. The threat of using something in cyberspace is not as powerful as actually using it.
"...[I]f we're going to have an impact on an adversary, we have to persistently engage with that adversary ... we have to be able to impose cumulative costs...
"...[W]e must take this fight to the enemy, just as we do in other aspects of conflict. A persistence force has a much higher chance of disrupting adversary plots and protecting Americans, compared with a force that is confined to sporadic reconnaissance."

Not Just Hacking Metrics
· This is a policy question · Rooted to
· Goals of US policymakers; · Understanding of adversary geopolitical goals and action (not just their
hacking teams); and · Statistics of security incidents

Not Just Science, But Political Science!
Negative or Positive Feedback
· If negative feedback, then US counter-offensives will shepherd adversaries back to previous, more stable norms
· Decrease in extreme, dangerous, de-stabilizing incidents
· Adversary behavior is less destabilizing next year than this year
· If positive feedback, then US counter-offensives amplify current trends, moving farther from previous norms
· Increase in aggressive/reckless, brazen incidents

Implied Hypothesis Of USG Argument

Problem

1. Adversaries are conducting free-for-all attacks to destabilize the United States (and its allies) and erode sources of national power;
2. U.S. cyber forces must defend forward against these threats, maneuvering to positions of advantage in foreign cyberspace to maintain persistent presence so "as the adversary tries to maneuver, we can actually stay with the adversary;"

3. To achieve this advantage, the U.S. cyber forces must operate with reduced operational constraints, "to act as we see emerging threats and opportunities in this space;"

4. With persistent presence, the United States can "intercept and halt cyber threats," enter "an adversary's network to learn what they are doing as a means of improving defenses," and "degrade the infrastructure and other resources that enable our adversaries to fight in cyberspace"

Method

5. Persistent presence will improve U.S. defenses, as DoD observes adversary behavior and warns targets of the facts and methods of coming (or ongoing) attacks,;
6. Together, these actions impose friction to, in the short term, directly disrupt specific adversary operations;

7. Friction will also, in the medium term, tie up adversaries forcing them to spend more resources responding to U.S. actions and rebuilding degraded infrastructure, reducing their ability to attack;

8. Also in the medium term, there will be a stabilizing process of tacit bargaining between adversaries as they mutually discover the upper and lower bounds of conflict through repeated interactions;

9. U.S. cyber forces will simultaneously use more purely offensive cyber capabilities for deterrence purposes, to threaten targets that adversaries value, making clear the strategic costs of attacking the United States and reducing their willingness to attack;

Result

10. Adversaries will, over the long term, moderate their behavior in response to U.S. actions, creating a more stable environment and continued U.S superiority.

US actions impose negative feedback: stimulus to revert to previous norm

FRAMEWORKS TO ANSWER THE QUESTION

Three Basic Frameworks
· US Government Incident Severity Score
· Strengths: Already used by DHS, White House including non-public incidents, best at ability to be correlated with USG actions or policy
· Weakness: Not tied to context, will miss unknown incidents, may be classified
· Tracking of Significant Incidents
· Strengths: Simple to use and can largely be done with open sources, can be transparent and public to allow analytical discourse
· Weaknesses: Cannot correlate directly with USG actions or policy, not tied to context, and will miss unknown incidents
· Deep Dive on Particular Adversary/Goal Pairings
· Strengths: Best at measuring context, can be transparent and public to allow analytical discourse
· Weaknesses: Cannot correlate directly with USG actions or policy

(1) USG Incident Severity System
Simple Count of Serious Incidents
If cyber_level = {3,4,5} then count = count+1 Plotted as time series
Very messy but simple and integrates with existing government response process

(2) Tracking of Significant Incidents
Incidence of "OPM-Style Incidents"

Case 1: Bolton's Intent
After the new policy enacted, reduction in significant events
New Deterrence Policy

Case 2: Critic's Fear
After the new policy enacted, increase in significant events

(2) Tracking of Significant Incidents
Incidence of "OPM-Style Incidents"
· Case wouldn't be "proven" or "disproven" either way, but evidence is suggestive...
· Failure is louder than success
23

(2) Tracking of Significant Incidents
Incidence of "OPM-Style Incidents"
1. Still messy but maybe less so 2. Tied more directly to policymaker goals 3. Not correlated to specific US cyber actions 4. Many (most?) "OPM-style incidents" are
widespread/disruptive and can be found in open source 5. Allows more analytical transparency

(3) Deep Dives on Particular Adversary/Goal Pairings
· Best example so far: · FireEye, "Red Line Drawn" report
FireEye, Red Line Drawn: China Recalculates Its Use of Cyber Espionage, June 2016

(3) Deep Dives on Particular Adversary/Goal Pairings
· Was there was an actual decrease in Chinese espionage operations for commercial purposes?
· Perhaps the number of incidents held steady, but the bulk were not detected due to improved Chinese stealthiness.
· This is generally a question for cyber threat analysts.
· How much of any Chinese response was the result of the U.S. policy?
· Perhaps the Chinese primarily acted for their own reasons, in response to domestic Chinese pressures, and U.S. policies had little additional impact.
· This is a question best answered by China experts.
· Did the decrease matter?
· Perhaps the few networks still being compromised were those most critical to national security, so the overall impact was not meaningfully diminished.
· This is a question best answered by the policymakers themselves.

(3) Deep Dives on Particular Adversary/Goal Pairings
1. Far less messy 2. Tied more directly to policymaker goals 3. Not correlated to specific US cyber actions 4. Allows more analytical transparency and
specificity 5. Significant effort 6. Still can't prove cause and effect

Three Basic Frameworks
· US Government Incident Severity Score
· Strengths: Already used by DHS, White House including non-public incidences, best at ability to be correlated with USG actions or policy
· Weakness: Not tied to context, will miss unknown incidents, likely to be classified
· Tracking of Significant Incidents

Shortcomings 1/3
· Effect of U.S. actions may be swamped by technical developments
· An increase in the number of reported incidents could be due to new classes of vulnerabilities, a flood of new and insecure Internet-of-things devices, or improvements in detection and defense
· The deployment of more secure infrastructure would lead to fewer attacks as would an increase in adversary use of "living off the land" and obfuscation techniques
· Control:
· Check competing hypotheses by comparing trendlines between adversaries, especially "deep-dive"

Shortcomings 2/3
· Many attacks (and adversary motivations) are hidden and data can be hard to come by and analyze
· Geopolitical events could cause adversaries to decrease or increase their use of cyber capabilities for strategic ends regardless of U.S. counter-offensive operations
· Controls:
· Having an exact enumeration of the events in each category matters less than the direction and magnitude of the trends
· Advocates of persistent engagement suggest it should have a substantial, perhaps unprecedented impact on adversary behavior.
· Anything other than a correspondingly strong reduction suggests the policy may not be working as intended
· Have multiple analytical teams with different data sources: USG, academia, cyber threat analysts

Shortcomings 3/3
· Significant methodological factors will hinder any direct assessment of correlation or causation
· Timescale to discover cyber incidents hampers assessment as incidents are often not known until well after they are conducted
· May be so few truly dangerous attacks that an increase or decrease of a small number of incidents leads to an enormous percentage increase or decrease
· System is chaotic so that cause and effect are often indistinguishable
· Control:
· Appropriate structuring of the framework and coding of the data · Giving up, because no strategy can have any measurable effect

DESCRIBING TRANSGRESSIONS TO BE MEASURED

Future Work
· Research historical antecedents of persistent engagement. · Similarities to other examples of where military and intelligence
forces of the two blocs during the Cold War were in routine belligerent contact:
· Anti-submarine warfare · Espionage-counterespionage · Freedom-of-navigation operations, and · Surveillance, and "exciter" flights against each other's homelands

Indicators for "Cyber Peace Index"
· What observable indicators of fewer or less serious transgressions? Of more and more serious transgressions?
· Frequency of incidents targeted at/disrupting core infrastructure (DNS, BGP)
· Increase or decrease in DDoS severity (peak intensity, number of highintensity attacks)
· Fewer active nation-state groups

Call to Action
· If you believe this new offensive posture is going to make it more difficult to protect the entities you are being paid to defend, then let us know
· Talk about it, blog about it, tweet about it · And if you include data along with your opinion, policymakers are much
more likely to listen to you
· How can the network defense community help?
· Help us pick the best frameworks, develop them, and ­ most importantly ­ use them!
· Share your results with the community, whether in a trust group or publicly via blogs and reports
· If we don't start measuring now, we'll just be that much further behind
