Agenda
Who is this APIC you are talking about? You said you have found vulns! Where are they? Ok, fine! But what can I take away from this?

Introduction

The What and the Why
The What
Vulnerability Assessment of Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI)
The Why
Not much research has been done, since Cisco ACI is expensive

Lab Setup

Application Centric Infrastructure
Nexus 9k Spine Switches

Nexus 9k Leaf Switches

Different Systems
Hypervisor

Bare Metal Server

Database Server

System Details
Nexus 9k Leaf/Spine Switches  Intel Xeon CPU (64 bit)  Analyzed mainly Software Version 14.0(3d)  Wind River Linux (kernel 3.14.62)  ~300 processes, only two running as non-root user
Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC)  Intel Xeon CPU (64 bit)  Analyzed mainly Software Version 14.1(1j)  CentOS 7 Linux (kernel 4.14.104)  ~500 processes, only ~20 running as non-root user

Recommendations
 Update immediately!  Watch out for new Updates.  Think about how to use your ACI fabric.  Restrict Access to the management interfaces.  Deactivate LLDP wherever it is not necessary.  Do not import Device Packages from
Spam/4chan/Stackoverflow !
