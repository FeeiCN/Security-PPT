Shape of a Challenge | Logical Paths

Guess what the challenge developer is thinking.
"Defeat the Enemy with one shot and submit the flag."
"Trying to hit the enemy? What are his coordinates? Once you figure that out, try wscat or just the Developer Console in your browser to make the shot."
"Can you figure out how? Where would you shoot to defeat the Enemy in a single shot?"
