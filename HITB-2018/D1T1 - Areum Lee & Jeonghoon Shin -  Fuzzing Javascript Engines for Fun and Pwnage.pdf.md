WHAT WE AIMED TO DO

1. Find vulnerabilities in browser javascript engines!
 v8  javascript core  chakra core  spider monkey
2. Utilize fuzzer!

WHY TARGET BROWSERS?

 Everyone uses web browsers.  If a browser is vulnerable, a lot of people are prone to
attacks.
 Web standards are continuously being updated. 
New features are added continuously.
 More changes to code. So more chance of bugs?
 Web browser security is super important.

WHY JAVASCRIPT?
 Javascript is easier to exploit compared to DOM objects

WHY JAVASCRIPT?

 Documentation of ECMA Script is well maintained
 If a zero-day is found, it will work on similar js engine
versions

WHY FUZZING?

 It saves time!  It creates many test cases in a short time  You can focus on other work while the computer runs
the fuzzer.
 If you can't find bugs via source code auditing, 
you have somewhere to turn to.

HOW WE DID IT

 Create a Javascript Fuzzing
Factory
 Manage fuzzing nodes using
Docker
 Make fuzzer create test cases
based on existing 1day cases.
 Test case does not need to have
any meaning to it. Just needs to create crashes!

CHARACTERISTICS & ENVIRONMENT

[ CHARACTERISTICS ]

JFF - JAVASCRIPT FUZZING FACTORY
 Comprises of :
1. Docker
- js engines and fuzzer run within the docker nodes
2. Web management platform
- Use node js API to control the docker

BELLA

 Mutation based  Apply mutations on existing 1days by finding patterns
 Why?  There are too many cases.  Hard to find pattern by hand.
 How?  Create template from existing 1days.  Make minimal changes to create random JS file.

21

LEGO

 Our approach to create JS syntax  Name given to the template created from 1days.

 Parse 1-day PoCs for making LEGO file  Parse LEGO file to make a new JS file.

 Excluded whatever was not important

BENJAMIN

 Generation based  make by using input grammar

 How?  Create input grammar by using library

BENJAMIN

 Problem!  Test cases have fixed form  Have to be randomized

 Solution  Make API!

WE'RE STILL FAR FROM PERFECT

 We need good code coverage.  JFF is small-scale compared to those being used in big
companies.
 Limitations to creating different types of JS templates.  The sequence of API usage may be limited
 We have few minor bugs.

FUTURE PLANS

 Keep track of ECMA Script updates and add to fuzzer
 ECMA script updates will also be applied to javascript
engine
 Enhance JFF to support other vectors
