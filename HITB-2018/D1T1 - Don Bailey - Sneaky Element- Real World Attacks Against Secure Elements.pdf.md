The Capgras Delusion

Attacking Perception
 Impersonate any WAC device  Trick users into handing you
cryptographic secrets  Abuse automated workflows  Gain access to network(s)

Attacking Apple WAC
 Wireless Accessory Config  Way to hand off secrets from iOS to an IoT accessory  Specification under Apple NDA  But we'll describe it anyway ;-)

Step 1: Hostapd
 Take any hostapd capable WiFi adapter  Recommend TP-LINK TL-WN722N  Configure SSID with Any SSID You Like  Add a Vendor Specific Element

WiFi Vendor Elements
 WiFi Beacons are composed of Elements  Basic Type Length Value format  Each Element defines a specific WiFi AP attribute  Such as `SSID' or `Supported Speed' or `Supported
Encryption'  A Vendor Element is data Specific to a Manufacturer

Step 2: MFI Config
 iOS will mDNS for the owner of _mfi_config  Forward request over bridged network with MOOPS  Forward responses back  Allows bridging "fake" WiFi Accessory with Real one

Step 3: Hacked Accessory
 Now any hacked accessory with a MFi chip gives you keys
 MFi will delegate WiFi keys to its host device  Use MFi as your own skeleton key

Why Does This Work?

Common SE Use Cases

Common Use Cases
 Secure Boot  Attestation  Self Identification  Peer Identification

Why MFi Fails

It's Obvious Now
 External Chip Model is critically flawed  An External SE can only identify itself  Without proper provisioning/personalization it cannot
identify its Host Device  Even with proper P&P the host device is vulnerable
without an Internal SE  Even with an internal SE, there are still gaps!
