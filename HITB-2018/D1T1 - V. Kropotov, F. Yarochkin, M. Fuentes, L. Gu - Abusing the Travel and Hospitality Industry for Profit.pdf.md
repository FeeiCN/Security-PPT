Not So Happy customer...
A buyer contacted the escrow company complaining about abuse because he didn't received the tickets on time and it's now been 15 hours overdue. The Escrow company gives 48 hours for explanations from the service provider. Service provider claims that tickets had been issued and cancelled by the issuer 3 times already and now it's the 4th attempt. If it doesn't work, the service provider will cover the Escrow costs.

mainframe computers and leased lines. The systems have since

been interwoven with web services, but still lack several web
