Phishing Incidents and Response Processes at SOC Teams

 What is a phishing alert?
 User receives a suspicious
email, so forwards it to phishing@organization.com
4 |  2019 Palo Alto Networks, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

 What happens behind the scenes?
 SOC (security operation center) analyst is assigned to investigate the suspicious email

Classic Phishing Handling Process

1 2 345 6

EXTRACT URLs/ HASH/DOMAINS
FROM ATTACHMENTS, EMAIL BODY &
HEADERS

ENRICH THOSE WITH THREAT INTEL SERVICES (VIRUSTOTAL)

SEND ATTACHMEN
T TO SANDBOX

LOOK AT THE EMAIL BODY CONTENT AND
HEADER

DECIDE IS IT: MALICIOUS/SPAM/
SCAM/ VALID

RESPOND TO USER

 Decrease the amount of time to make a decision  Help the analyst make a better decision

Datasets
 Valid  Scam  Spam  Malicious
 We collected ~100K labeled emails from 10 different customers  All the emails are suspicious emails, other than the most
email gateway datasets

Process Followed to Build the Model
 Research: email headers, IOCs, email body  Text classification model: FastText (word embedding & NN)  Explainability - highlighting important words, using Lime
https://github.com/marcotcr/lime
 We aimed for at least 80% precision. Remember SOC teams are not 100% correct with their alerts decisions!

Model Deployment
 We support 2 ways of using our phishing models:
a. Building a dedicated model based on a specific customer env
within Demisto on a permanent env
 Supervised  Semi-Supervised
a. Upon request, Demisto DS builds a model and deploys it within
Demisto

Using a Model in Demisto
 Use as part of scoring/severity set  Close incidents automatically with probability > THRESHOLD  Handle incidents that were not handled in the past due to low capacity
