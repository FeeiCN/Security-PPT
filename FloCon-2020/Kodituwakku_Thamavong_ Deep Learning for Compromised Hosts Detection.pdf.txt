OUTLINE
 Objective: Improving analyst daily workflow and data understanding  Analyst-Data Science Challenge  Motivation  Scope  Introduction to Deep Learning  Dataset creation  Technical methodology  Model training and tuning  Results  Case studies

THE ANALYST-DATA SCIENCE CHALLENGE
 Understanding the "why"?  Asking the right questions  Iteration of ideas and solutions  Model generation and validation  Use the model to prioritize the actionable events  Start analyst workflow

MOTIVATION
 Issues with current datasets.  Outdated.  Simulated.  Does not reflect current threats.  Can't collect the same features from real networks.
 Issues with current statistical models  Unusable in practice  Static models can't be used for streaming data

DEEP LEARNING
 Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical
learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks.
 Learn from training data.  Find progressively higher-order
patterns in input data.
 Requires  Need quality training data.  Tuning of hyperparameters.  Testing.

DATA SOURCES
 Flow data from GLORIAD research & education network  Global Ring Network for Advanced Applications Development  National Science Foundation sponsored project 2006-2015  Closest to real-world global scale flow data
 Maxmind Geolocation data  Emerging Threats Compromised IPs blacklist  Global Science Registry (maps IP blocks to institutions)

SCOPE OF RESEARCH
 Why Emerging Threats' Known Compromised Hosts Threat-list ?  Can use to enrich streaming flow data on-the-fly  Signatures that we can train a statistical model to detect  Freely available  Actively kept up-to-date
 What is the Known Compromised Hosts Threat-list?
"Hosts that are known to be compromised by bots, phishing sites, etc, or known to be spewing hostile traffic. These are not your everyday infected and sending a bit of spam hosts, these are significantly infected and hostile hosts."

METHODOLOGY
Objective: Find the best weights and the bias for each neuron.
