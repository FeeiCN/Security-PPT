 Inspired by
 SPLT feature in Deciphering Malware's use of TLS (without Decryption) [1]  Implementation of feature extraction - Joy [2]
 Generalizes across protocols - works on encrypted ones, too
 Lengths of data  Order of data  Direction of data
 Combines well with rule based expert systems - maybe ML, too

Zeek : "a powerful network analysis framework that is much different from the typical IDS you may know." [6]
 SDN approach to network security monitoring
 Event-driven scripting language
 Protocol parsing
 Analyzers detach once encryption begins to save resources  SOL can be used instead of full parsing
 Logging, file extraction, intel matching, and more

Within Zeek, sequences can be represented as vectors
vector : "An associate array that maps from one set of values to another... its indices are non-negative integers, starting from zero"[4]
 Originator message lengths are positive  Responder message lengths are negative  Order is preserved using vector indices

v: vector of int = {24, -24, 48, -12, 36, -42, 24, -124, -12, 96, -48, -48, 48}

Useful vector operations for rule building:
 Index slicing (heads and tails)  Summary statistics (max, min, mean, range, etc)  "Runs"
 Increasing  Decreasing  Repeating
 PCR [7]  Find first, second, third occurrence of...
 Positive  Negative  "run"

 SSH consists of 3 sub-protocols
 Transport  Authentication  Connection
 SSH cleartext handshake/negotiations
 SSH PDUs are called messages
 One or more messages are formatted in an SSH "packet" struct

 Authentication
 Bruteforce guessing  Interactive vs automated authentication
 Password vs pubkey
 Mode of use
 File transfers vs keystrokes
 Timing profiles  Counting keystrokes
 Root password lengths, oh my!
 State machine transitions
 Authentication bypass exploits
 do not pass authentication, do not collect $200
 Protocol is SSH in the clear and something different once encrypted

SPLT can be used to identify malware communications over TLS. Can it conceptually be applied to identify other application layer protocols? I think so. DNS has intrinsic size ceilings/floors and expected PCRs [7]

 Apply LSTM RNNs to investigate application layer protocols' SOLs  Incorporate timing deltas (sequence of times/deltas)
 Timing of specific pkts or states of a protocol can be insightful
 Generically identifying TCP proxies:
 Align sequences of two connections (within a time window)  If one sequence is a multiple of the other, it may be a tunnel
