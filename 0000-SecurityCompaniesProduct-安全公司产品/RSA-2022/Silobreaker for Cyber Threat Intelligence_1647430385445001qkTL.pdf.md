Silobreaker for Cyber Threat Intelligence
The OSINT platform providing unparalleled visibility of threats outside your perimeter.

Cyber threats continue to grow in complexity and scale. While most reporting on cyber threat activity is publicly available, few organisations have the tools or personnel to effectively analyse and act on it, leaving critical intelligence on the table.
Silobreaker is trusted by intelligence teams across the globe to make sense of their threat landscape. By automatically analysing and contextualising unstructured data from over a million open, closed, deep and dark web sources, Silobreaker does the heavy lifting, so you can efficiently identify and understand cyber threats in the context of your organisation. Arm your team with real-time contextual intelligence so you can make faster, better informed decisions about the threats that matter most.
