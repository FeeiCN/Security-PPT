YOU DESERVE THE BEST SECURITY
HARMONY CONNECT CHECK POINT'S SASE SOLUTION
THE ONLY PREVENTION-FIRST SASE

HARMONY CONNECT--CHECK POINT'S SASE SOLUTION 2

CONNECTIVITY AND SECURITY NEEDS ARE EVOLVING
New work models require new security paradigms, as organizations shift from a concentrated, centralized IT model to a widely distributed one. Remote and hybrid work are the new normal. Applications reside everywhere, consumed as SaaS (e.g Office 365) or hosted on premises and cloud-based data centers (IaaS). And branch offices increasingly bypass security engines to connect directly to the cloud.
THE RESULT: COMPLEXITY IN ENSURING, MANAGING AND SCALING NETWORK SECURITY
The new perimeter, defined by cloud, mobile and remote work has signification implications on the entire organization:
Complex Management  Scaling hardware-dependent remote access
infrastructure impedes agility.

 Managing multiple point products leads to high overhead and inconsistent policies.
Increased Security Risk  As users access networks and applications
outside the perimeter firewall, your organization's attack surface expands.
 Broad network access increases the risk of lateral movement and can lead to a breach.
 Supporting secure access for unmanaged and BYOD devices becomes challenging.
Poor User Experience  Routing all internet and cloud-bound traffic
to the on-prem datacenter for security inspection causes congestion, latency and downtime for users.
Fragmented Visibility  Disparate solutions make it difficult to gain
a single audit trail of all user activity, and obfuscate the organization's true security posture.

HARMONY CONNECT--CHECK POINT'S SASE SOLUTION 3

HARMONY CONNECT: SECURELY CONNECT TO EVERYTHING
To secure the distributed enterprise, organizations need a Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) architecture.
Check Point Harmony Connect redefines SASE by making it easy to access corporate applications, SaaS and the internet for any user or branch, from any device, without compromising on security.
Built to prevent the most advanced cyber attacks, Harmony Connect is a cloud-native service that unifies multiple cloud-delivered network security products, deploys within minutes and applies Zero Trust policies with a seamless user experience.
Tightly integrating with leading SD-WAN services, Harmony Connect combines client- and cloudbased protection to deliver enterprise-grade security with less than 50ms latency and a 99.999% uptime--allowing organizations to scale remote access with peace of mind.

INDUSTRY LEADING NETWORK SECURITY FOR ENTERPRISE USE CASES
Harmony Connect provides comprehensive security from the cloud to secure remote access to enterprise applications, secure internet access and browsing for remote users, and protects direct connections from branch offices to the cloud by securing organizations' current SD-WAN infrastructures.
BENEFITS  Industry's best malware catch rate with
top-rated threat prevention  Zero Trust Network Access with choice of
network- or application-level access to cloud and on-prem apps  Rich clientless access to corporate apps; ideal for BYOD, partners and contractors  Cloud secure web gateway for remote user internet access  Branch firewall-as-a-service for your SD-WAN infrastructure  Reduced operational overheads  Consume security-as-a-service

HARMONY CONNECT--CHECK POINT'S SASE SOLUTION 4

Zero Trust Network Access
Harmony Connect Remote Access takes only five minutes to deploy and enforces an identity-centric zero trust access policy to secure any internal corporate application residing in the data center, IaaS, public or private clouds.
By integrating with enterprise identity providers, user access is secured by single sign on and multi-factor authentication, with additional assurance offered by Harmony Connect's device posture validation.
The service comes in two flavors that can be deployed side-by-side from the same console to accommodate different use cases and personas. As detailed below, these include clientless-application level access and clientbased network-level access.

CLIENTLESS APPLICATION-LEVEL ACCESS
Harmony Connect Remote Access offers clientless remote access to any internal corporate application residing in the data center, IaaS, public or private clouds. With no agent installation or management required, the clientless deployment option is ideal for BYOD and third party users, such as contractors and partners.
Thanks to intuitive access to Web, RDP, SSH and SQL-based resources, the service is both user and management friendly, while catering to the needs of diverse personnel. Business and third-party users enjoy agentless access, administrators gain complete visibility and granular in-app controls, while DevOps benefit from a wealth of cloud-native capabilities including privileged access management (PAM) and automated server onboarding.

HARMONY CONNECT--CHECK POINT'S SASE SOLUTION 5

CLIENT-BASED NETWORK-LEVEL ACCESS
Harmony Connect Remote Access also offers a client-based network-level access deployment option (Early Availability), delivering VPN-as-a-service that provides the power of layer-3 network connectivity, secured by customizable Zero-Trust access policy.
Ideal for employee access from any managed device, this option is more versatile in supporting applications and protocols, with embedded cloud DLP and industry-leading IPS to protect your apps from the latest vulnerabilities (such as Log4J).
For increased remote access security, network-level access is protected with device posture validation (optional), performing additional checks before access is granted.
