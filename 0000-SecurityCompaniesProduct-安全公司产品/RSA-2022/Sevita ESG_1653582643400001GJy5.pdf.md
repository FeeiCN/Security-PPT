Onspring Case Study: Environment, Social & Governance (ESG) Solution

Integrating an Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) Strategy into Your GRC Programs
A Healthcare & Human Services Case Study

OVERVIEW
With new market demand for an effective and long-term strategy to improve ESG initiatives, Sevita identified Onspring as a simple tool to execute their plans and manage year-over-year performance tracking. Annual self-assessments evaluated the organization's performance across seven focal areas, and automated notifications to assign owners with resolution tasks for underperforming scores.
"Onspring is fantastic. We can easily track ESG assessments & tasks while viewing our ESG score year-over-year."
