Outsourcing PKI to the Cloud
Why You Should Replace On-Premise PKI With PKI-as-a-Service
-E B O O K

"In recent years, PKI has evolved from a means to protect websites, into the heart of the digital management function within the cybersecurity structure. Today, it is used to manage digital identities, applications and devices within companies.
It is also being adopted and deployed by IT teams to combat a growing variety of cybersecurity threats, spanning distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks to malware, and phishing attempts to the hacking of internet of things (IoT) devices."
--Computer Weekly, Outsourcing PKI to the cloud: What enterprises need to know1

Executive Summary
Businesses are under an ever-increasing demand to move services online, take advantage of cloud infrastructure, and integrate extensively with other systems. This does bring significant benefits -- the enterprise can take advantage of operational agility and scalability and use this to build a competitive advantage. But there are risks, too. The proliferation of new endpoints, an increase in remote working, the insistence on accessibility and integration everywhere, and the IoT revolution all come with a significant concern -- security.
Managing security at scale is a major overhead for organizations. As hackers and criminals become more sophisticated, it's more important than ever to create strong, robust and proven methods to encrypt information and verify access rights. The gold standard for securing information across the network is through public key infrastructure (PKI).
When it comes to implementing PKI, businesses have some options. They can develop a DIY on-premise PKI system using services like Microsoft Certificate Authority and Active Directory Certificate Services. While this may initially seem like a good idea, as the need for PKI management grows, a DIY in-house system can quickly become overburdened and slow to react. Add to this a multitude of hidden costs and significant engineering resources, and any advantages are quickly eliminated.
Another option for businesses is to use an on-demand, cloud-based PKI solution, commonly referred to as PKI-as-a-Service (PKIaaS). PKIaaS provides a PKI platform that will rapidly and effortlessly integrate with existing networks and systems to provide best-in-class security for data transfer. Even better, PKIaaS is provided on a subscription basis, making it much easier for businesses to control budgets and remove the need for a large, upfront CapEx investment.
While we believe that PKIaaS offers significant benefits over a DIY PKI system, we realize that choosing the right security infrastructure has profound implications. To help you decide, we've explored several aspects of the DIY on-premise PKI system versus cloud-based PKIaaS platforms. By the end of this paper, you will have a clear idea of what each type of service can provide, and why PKIaaS is likely to be your better choice.

Digital Transformation in the Enterprise Relies on Strong Security Foundations
The demand for flexible, scalable, user-focused technologies has never been greater.2 This drive for digital transformation is irresistible, with marketplace forces demanding that companies adapt. As businesses upgrade their networks and IT systems to take advantage of this new world, a robust, responsive, and strong security infrastructure is critical.3
Companies need to verify that cloud environments, DevOps, endpoints, remote access, IoT devices, and other areas meet robust encryption and verification standards to access sensitive networks. Secure, encrypted access is a vital foundation for digital transformation.
PKI is a critical foundation to provide secure data transfer and encryption.
"Applications running in the cloud and data stored there are not protected by a traditional corporate security perimeter of firewalls and the like. As a result, security becomes essentially reliant on encryption and management of the keys that provide access to encrypted data. Our interviews revealed that most companies, especially large ones, do not entrust SaaS providers to host and manage their security keys. The majority prefer to hold their keys on-premises through a hardware security module, retain management control of cloud-hosted keys, or use a combination of methods."
--McKinsey, Securing software as a service4

A Quick Explanation of Public Key Infrastructure
PKI creates two special, secure, paired keys (public keys and private keys) through a complex algorithm. These keys encrypt data traveling between users, systems, customers, applications, and devices. Prior to transmission, data is encrypted using the "public" part of the key pairing. When the data arrives at its destination, the paired "private" key is used to decrypt the data.
Implementing public key infrastructure in the enterprise is central to allowing the secure exchange of sensitive information and authentication. Introducing, managing and supporting on-premise PKI can be challenging, requiring cybersecurity teams to balance several areas.
That's why an adaptable, cloud-based PKI-as-a-Service (PKIaaS) solution can provide the scale and flexibility a business needs to deal with the most demanding security challenges.
PKI is becoming more central to reducing the concerns of cybersecurity managers.
As a foundational security technology implemented for decades, public key infrastructure (PKI) is already deployed in most enterprise IT infrastructures. However, the ongoing management and maintenance of an in-house PKI deployment can be difficult and requires dedicated, skilled staff -- adding to overall security costs. An on-demand PKIaaS solution can significantly reduce those costs and keep them under control.

Cybersecurity Experts Know That Robust PKI Is Essential
A report from our colleagues at Dark Reading5 highlighted some of the main concerns of security experts toward cybersecurity management:
 70% say that their cybersecurity staff are stretched too thin  49% say the complexity of the security environment is their biggest challenge  40% expect that security challenges will become a lot harder in the near future, even though
budgets and staff will remain the same  39% have made remote access the top cybersecurity priority So, with the choice of DIY PKI or PKIaaS, how do they stack up?
Credential compromises are now more commonplace, with 41% of access keys remaining unchanged in the cloud in the past 90 days.
CloudStandards.org, Cloud Computing Statistics: 2020 Overview6

"Cloud-based PKIaaS or managed PKI is a growing trend with more and more IT leaders considering it as a valid option. PKIaaS providers automate client certificate lifecycles and include dedicated staff, systems, and distributed datacenters that scale and meet the growing needs of their clients, while also providing the platform to improve efficiency and effort required to manage all company certificates."

On-Premise PKI vs. Cloud-Based PKI-as-a-Service
Traditional, on-premise PKI can work -- up to a point. The problem is that as networks and integrations become more complex, and endpoints grow, managing that environment at scale becomes increasingly difficult and expensive.
If you run your own on-premise PKI services, you're limited by the capabilities and demands of your PKI infrastructure. This could mean significant extra investment as you add or update services. Instead, it makes much more sense to use an adaptable PKI that can expand as your technology footprint and user base grow.
PKI-as-a-Service is a cloud-based solution that lets you tailor and expand your PKI services as needed.
PKIaaS means you can:
 Add and change PKI security services at any time -- Get adaptable PKI as needed, meaning you can increase capacity and expand technologies without upfront investment or concerns about demand
 Deploy scalable PKI services quickly and accurately -- Speed and quality are essential to ramping up PKI in a scalable and manageable way. PKIaaS grows alongside your business and security needs.

PKIaaS Supports Digital Transformation in Multiple Ways
Although greater flexibility and reduced costs are powerful incentives for businesses, PKIaaS isn't just about the bottom line. There are several other significant ways that it can support your business, for example PKIaaS:
 Automatically implements industry-leading best practices for PKI. Stay ahead of potential attackers and breaches by using a complete PKI solution that's continually updated and takes advantage of the latest thinking in security research.
 Introduces a baseline of "Zero Trust." Only allow access to assets through robust security permissions tied to individuals, job roles, devices, and processes through your organization.
 Meets compliance and regulatory guidelines for PKI security. Ensure your PKI solution remains fully compliant with standards and regulations.
 Controls budgets and reduces costs for PKI operations and projects. Control PKI security costs for both your day-to-day operational needs and for any program or project that increases the scope of security in your organization.
To raise the benefits of PKIaaS, it's important to see how a DIY on-premise PKI solution could function, specifically those using Microsoft services.

Microsoft Certificate Authority, Active Directory Certificate Services and DIY PKI
Some enterprises and cybersecurity managers may still be building or using a DIY PKI system. Microsoft Certificate Authority (MCA) and Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) are still popular choices, but are they the right ones?
A QUICK OVERVIEW OF AD CS AND MCA
AD CS and MCA are part of the Windows Server operating system. They manage digital certificates for accessing applications and information on the corporate network. Cybersecurity teams can use MCA and AD CS to implement their own, locally-installed DIY PKI security services. MCA provisions the certificates while AD CS administers them.
Microsoft describes AD CS as follows:8
"AD CS provides customizable services for issuing and managing digital certificates used in software security systems that employ public key technologies. The digital certificates that AD CS provides can be used to encrypt and digitally sign electronic documents and messages. These digital certificates can be used for authentication of computer, user, or device accounts on a network. Digital certificates are used to provide:
 Confidentiality through encryption  Integrity through digital signatures  Authentication by associating certificate keys with computer, user, or device accounts on
a computer network
You can use AD CS to enhance security by binding the identity of a person, device, or service to a corresponding private key."
Let's dig into the advantages and disadvantages.

ADVANTAGES OF MCA AND AD CS
 Active Directory integration reduces the need to reregister certificates  Existing group policies can be used to avoid the need to creating new PKI policies  MCA provides automated certificate provisioning while AD CS handles lifecycle management  Certificates are automatically installed without end user involvement
This all sounds great, but unfortunately AC DS and MCA have some significant drawbacks.
DRAWBACKS OF MCA AND AD CS
 Upfront hardware costs: There's a significant CapEx cost for creating a DIY PKI service, including the need to protect and store private keys on secure hardware like a hardware security module (HSM)
 Ongoing costs: Ongoing maintenance costs for maintaining DIY PKI infrastructure can be substantial and can include deploying patches across the environment and backing up critical certificate data
 Validation of certificates: Extra resources and technology will be required for maintaining validation services to ensure the validity of MCA-provisioned certificates
 PKI expertise: On-staff PKI experts will be required to implement, manage, maintain and integrate your DIY PKI solution  Lack of flexibility: As security needs evolve, you will need to quickly adapt DIY PKI to support the latest devices and use cases  Difficulties with compliance: Any DIY PKI solution implemented must meet regulatory and industry guidelines and frameworks  Demand management: As the need for certificates and PKI grows, it can be difficult for an MCA-centered solution to keep up  Limited automation: As it is core Microsoft technology, it doesn't provide automation for every machine and device on the network
MCA struggles with provisioning and managing more than a few thousand certificates with single instance. Each user and device can require multiple certificates, so it can be easy for an enterprise to hit these limits fast. PKIaaS helps you avoid these issues, and provides many of the same advantages as MCA and AD CS.

The Hidden Costs of On-Premise PKI
DIY PKI solutions can end up costing an enterprise much more than just the amount spent on hardware, backups, integrations and support. Some of the more subtle, hidden costs associated with on-premise PKI include:
 Administrative costs for setting up: - Enrollment and initial authorization - Registration authorities and integration - Authentication and identity and access management - Certificate templates and provisioning - PKI policies and other security protocols
 Regulatory, compliance, logging and audit costs  Certificate provisioning, revocation and lifecycle costs  Costs associated with key management and backups
This all consumes network resources, server time and cybersecurity engineer expertise.
There are other hidden costs too, like integrations with other systems, communicating requirements with touchpoints, and exhaustive testing of endpoints and new implementations.
PKIaaS eliminates the majority of these costs.
