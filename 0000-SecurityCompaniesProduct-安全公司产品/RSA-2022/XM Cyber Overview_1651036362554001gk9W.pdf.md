Attack Path Management
The Unified Hybrid Cloud Security Platform
See all the ways they'll attack. See all the ways to stop them.
Breaches, advanced persistent threats, ransomware and common hacks, routinely exploit well known attack paths in enterprise networks. Identifying, understanding and disrupting these attack paths before attackers can exploit them is critical to efficiently reduce the risk to the business and improve security posture. XM Cyber is changing the way organizations approach cyber risk. Now you can continuously see your hybrid network through the eyes of an attacker and spot attacks before they happen. You'll reduce your internal attack surface by uncovering hidden attack paths to your critical assets across cloud and on-prem networks. Cut them off at key junctures. And eradicate risk with a fraction of the effort.

No Blind Spots
Get a single, comprehensive view of all critical attack paths across your entire
hybrid network.

No Guesswork
Use analytics and modelling to know which attack paths a real-life attacker
would actually take, then you can pinpoint where best to disrupt the
attack path with step-by-step remediation guidance.

No Stopping
Conduct automated, continous risk reduction that's safe, scalable and simple
to deploy regardless of your dynamic environment.

See the attack before it happens.
With the Attack Path Management platform, you can see the attacker's perspective of your hybrid-cloud network with a full attack graph of your exposures and gain visibility into your security posture to proactively close security gaps. Pinpoint and prioritize attack paths and quickly remediate expolitable vulnerabilities, credentials, misconfigurations, user activities, and other IT security hygiene issues that attackers could otherwise leverage to compromise critical assets.
Contextualize
Always keep an eye on the paths to your critical assets  Manage attack paths across your on-prem, AWS, Azure or
GCP environments  Get graph-based modelling built from data collection and analysis of
what could potentially be exploited  Detect lateral movement opportunities  Get an automated platform for prioritizing and eliminating risk
Prioritize
Fix the most damaging attack paths first  Take a proactive approach by looking at all risks and prioritizing them by
the impact they pose to your critical assets  Always run up-to-date modeled scenarios against the newest threats
aligned with MITRE attack techniques  Know what to fix to disrupt the most damaging attack paths first
Resolve
When you eradicate key risks at the right point, the rest will go away  Cut off attack paths at key junctures (a.k.a choke points)  Save anaylyst time with detailed remediation steps  Close the loop, harden your environment and reduce the attack surface
Improve
Continuous improvement of security posture on a 24/7/365 basis across your hybrid network  Scale your risk management with a platform designed to run safely
and smoothly  Apply best practices and optimization tips whenever you need help  Quickly and continuously eradicate risks with automated remediation
planning that's embedded into your operation  Help drive business decisions and see that your security investments
are paying off
