Solution Brief

LogicHub for Small and Medium Enterprises
Automation-driven managed detection and response

Small and medium enterprises are disproportionately damaged by data breaches. According to the 2019 Cost of a Data Breach Report from the Ponemon Institute, an average data breach costs:
 $3,500 per employee for small organization (<1000 employees)
Versus
 $210 per employee for large organizations (>25,000 employees)
As a smaller organization, your proportional risk is substantially higher than larger, better funded organizations, and you're still expected to deliver the same level of protection, including:
 24x7 comprehenisve detection and response for user, network and endpoint-related threats
 Protection from a broad range of advanced attacks like ransomware, phishing, and stolen credentials
 Rapid incident response processes for any critical threat
But without the resources to fully staff and operate a 24x7 enterprise SOC, it's difficult for your team to build an effective security operations program and keep up with the overwhelming volume of potential threats and associate alerts on your own.

What You Need  Cost effective, 24x7 protection from
advanced threats
 Continuous monitoring of endpoint, network and user related log and event data
 Formal incident response processes that meet industry requirements
 Around-the-clock access to skilled security analysts and expert recommendations
