The Global State of DDoS Weapons, Threat Intelligence and Attack Mitigation

2022 DDoS Threat Report May2022

2022 A10 Networks, Inc. All rights reserved.

The COVID-19 pandemic provided a perfect storm for threat actors to intensify their efforts to disrupt services people use everyday like healthcare and education while also targeting critical infrastructure like supply chains. Even while the world eases into a more normal operating environment, cyber attacks, including state-sponsored attacks, only continue to increase.
A10 Networks security research team tracks distributed denial of service (DDoS) weapons and their nature and origins on an ongoing basis. The 2022 A10 Networks DDoS Threat Report provides insights into DDoS activity during the past six months including origins of activity; the growth of DDoS weapons and botnets; the role of malware in the propagation of DDoS weapons and attacks; and the steps organizations can take to protect against such activities.

Special Report: Cyber Warfare in the Russia-Ukraine Conflict
The ongoing conflict in Ukraine is an example of state-sponsored cyber warfare where cyber attacks like DDoS are being used not just as arbitrary tools of distraction or disruption in peacetime, but rather as closely coordinated attacks that compliment the physical confrontation on the ground.
2022 A10 Networks, Inc. All rights reserved.

DDoS Attacks Disrupt Critical Infrastructure and Communications
Cyber warfare is often thought of as the use of cyber attacks by nation-states or international organizations like Anonymous to disrupt government and other critical services. DDoS attacks have been used in the past by state-sponsored attackers as part of their cyber warfare tactics to effectively target critical infrastructure, such as utilities, phone and transportation services, or to stop communications between individuals or government bodies.
At the outset of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the A10 security research team observed significant and sustained attacks on Ukrainian government networks and commercial internet assets, with a massive spike on the first day of the conflict.

Many networks were targeted by a coordinated DDoS amplification and reflection attack. However, upon filtering the information, two particular targets stood out: The first target, PP Infoservis-Link, was somewhat obfuscated by the name returned from the automated look-up, and upon a closer look, one source listed this as geolocated to one of Ukraine's largest cities -- Kharkiv, while the whois information showed it as Severodonetsk, Ukraine. It was targeted by requests with the less common Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) protocol on UDP port 3,283. This protocol has an amplification factor of 34 -- a response size 34 times larger than the original request.
The second target, the Secretariat of the Cabinet of the Ministers of Ukraine, was likely a state-sponsored campaign.
In the second attack, a Network Time Protocol request was used for the DDoS amplification and reflection attack on UDP port 123. This is a common method of attack.
Both of these attacks, carried out on February 24, 2022, were extremely large in scale. However, there were consistent levels of smaller attacks against targets in Ukraine from a variety of UDP protocols. The A10 security research team will continue to track the cyber attack activity in the region and will provide updates on an ongoing basis and in the next edition of this report. More detailed information about the initial cyber attack activity can be found on A10 Networks' blog.

DDoS Attacks are Distributed in Nature
A single attack may employ multiple DDoS weapons and vectors to overwhelm the victim's network and defenses. Even though a single attack might be using attack nodes spread across the globe, there is still value in knowing the origin of these weapons as this information can help organizations create better and more precise DDoS protection policies.

Bot activity typically changes with each reporting period. In H2 2021, an 8% decrease in the total number of bots was observed. When organizations become aware of malicious activity in their networks, they take remedial actions and the infected systems are taken down. In some cases, such measures are taken by outside entities including law enforcement agencies or vigilantes. Increases and decreases in botnets can be attributed to:

 The growth of IoT and availability of new IoT devices  New vulnerabilities and CVEs exploited by attackers  Large-scale security updates to patch
CVEs in IoT devices  Botnet takedowns

The Apache Log4j Vulnerability and DDoS
2022 A10 Networks, Inc. All rights reserved.

A New Vector for Weapon Creation
Apache Log4j is a logging framework used for recording security and performance information and communicating diagnostic messages to system administrators. It is used by thousands of Java packages in a variety of consumer and enterprise products.
The disclosure of CVE-2021-44228 on December 10, 2021 was a real cause for concern as the scale of Log4j's use could extend to potentially billions of devices around the world.
According to NIST, the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) features within Log4j, used in configuration and logging, can easily be hijacked by attackers who can control log messages or log message parameters to execute malicious code loaded from LDAP servers. This is possible when the "message lookup substitution" option is enabled. Carrying out unauthenticated remote code executions (RCE) to install malware using Log4j is therefore very easy and this behavior was observed within the first few days after the disclosure of the CVE.

Identify and Isolate

1

Immediately identify and isolate products with the Log4j vulnerability. This can be done in multiple ways including disconnecting the affected devices from the network or creating a VLAN used to

separate affected devices.

Ensure Your Security is up to Date

2

Make sure that all devices are updated with the latest version of Log4j, that security infrastructure is updated regularly and that devices are running the latest version of firmware. Keep track of relevant

CVEs and seek out help if any patches are required. If fixes are not readily available, take appropriate

action based on the particular CVE.

Never Trust, Always Verify

3

Incorporate the Zero Trust model and its key principles into the organization's security strategy. Create micro-perimeters within networks. Limit access to resources and invest into modern,

AI/ML-based solutions. Ensure visibility into not only the endpoints and network nodes, but also

into users, their activities, and workflows.

Take a Closer Look at the Payloads

4

If network devices are unexpectedly generating large amounts of traffic, look at the payloads (i.e., the HTTP GET as in the example above). RegEx can be used to filter these malicious traffic

requests out and block them before they infect other devices.

Employ or Review DDoS Baselining and AI/MLTechniques

5

Using modern DDoS techniques like baselining to see anomalous behavior versus historical norms, and AI/ML techniques, for automated detection and mitigation of attacks, can be a force

multiplier for your security teams, giving them a much needed reprieve and helping them focus

on novel events.

Amplification Attacks and Weapons
Amplified reflection attacks result in some of the largest DDoS attacks. This attack strategy is to exploit the connectionless nature of the UDP protocol and spoof the victim's IP address.
While DDoS attackers are increasingly focused on smaller attacks launched persistently over a long period of time, the notoriety and capabilities of large-scale DDoS attacks cannot be diminished. Large-scale attacks, while less frequent, can still cause significant damage. While these large-scale attacks might not be as lucrative as continuously attacking an organization over time, they are used to make a statement. In the current environment state-sponsored cyber warfare and cyber activism are becoming much more common.

Leveraging Amplification Factors of Common Protocols
Amplified reflection attacks leverage the amplification factors of common protocols and services used across the internet. The most common types of these attacks can use millions of exposed DNS, NTP, SSDP, SNMP, and CLDAP UDP-based services.
Attackers send multiple requests to these services, spoofing the victim's IP address. The servers reply with large amplified responses. These particular servers are targeted because they answer to unauthenticated requests and are running applications or protocols with amplification capabilities. This has resulted in record-breaking volumetric attacks.

Methods for Exploiting SSDP
The Simple Service Discovery Protocol is used for advertising and discovering network services. It is the basis of the discovery protocol Universal Plug and Play (UPnP). SSDP-based DDoS attacks exploit the protocol by spoofing the victim's IP address and sending a large volume of response traffic reflected off plug-and-play devices open to the internet. The response generated can be larger than 30 times the request size. This large volume of traffic can make systems and organizations unresponsive or take them offline completely.
30x
SSDP-based DDoS attacks can generate more than 30x traffic volume making them some of the most devastating attacks.
Preventing SSDP-based DDoS Attacks
Unless there is a specific use case for SSDP across the internet, the most straightforward way to prevent these attacks is to block port 1900 traffic sourced from the internet. Alternatively, block SSDP traffic from specific geo-locations where a large number of botnet activity has been detected. These one or two steps provide surgical and preemptive protection against this type of DDoS attack.

Conclusion
2022 A10 Networks, Inc. All rights reserved.

While the world eases into a more normal operating environment, cyber-attacks, including state-sponsored attacks, will only continue to intensify. As we have witnessed, going back dozens of years, DDoS attacks are used as arbitrary tools of distraction or disruption for financial gain or to make a statement. And this year, we've seen clear evidence that closely coordinated attacks are being used as a complement to a physical confrontation on the ground.
A proactive approach to DDoS defense is essential to ensure critical services and infrastructure are protected.

A10 Networks Recommends:

Implementing Zero Trust strategies to identify and isolate problem areas.

Using modern AI/ML-based automated DDoS defenses to protect against all DDoS attacks including zero-day attacks, large-scale amplification attacks, and low-volume persistent DDoS attacks.

Monitoring devices, traffic, and users to ensure networks are not weaponized and used against the internet.
