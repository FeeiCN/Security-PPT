Reinvent the way your organization secures applications

With Mend, You Can:
Find application vulnerabilities
Mend's integrated application security platform scans your code to identify both open source vulnerabilities and security flaws in custom code.
Accelerate remediations
Mend is the only application security platform on the market that shows your developers exactly how to fix both open source and custom code security issues -- so remediations actually get done.
Improve security
Since Mend tells developers exactly how to fix vulnerabilities, no time is wasted researching issues. Mean Time to Remediation (MTTR) is reduced, and you have fewer vulnerabilities in production.
Prevent supply chain attacks
Identify and block suspicious and malicious third-party packages from entering your codebase.
Challenges Nearly every enterprise is now focused on developing custom applications to gain strategic advantage over the competition. At the same time, cyber attackers have increased their focus on applications. Studies show that attacks against application vulnerabilities are now the most common method of penetration.
In response to increased application-layer attacks, enterprise security teams need to provide their developers with more and better tools to reduce their software attack surface. Unfortunately, most application security tools are not well-suited for today's environment. They are slow, cumbersome to deploy and to use, and they flood developers with false positive alerts. And, while good at alerting, they are not not good at helping developers fix the problems.
Solution Mend's revolutionary application security platform addresses these problems. Mend integrates easily into your software development environment. It activates automatically and provides results within minutes. Mend is the only application security platform in the world that provides automated remediation workflows for both open source vulnerabilities and custom code. This high level of automation and remediation assistance is why developers love to use Mend. Why spend time researching how to fix a vulnerability when you don't have to?

MEND Solutions for Application Security

MENDSCA

MENDSAST

 Software composition analysis identifies open
source vulnerabilities in over 200 different languages, frameworks and development technologies.
 Automated prioritization* with patented reachability
path analysis shows you which vulnerabilities can be safely ignored.
 Automated remediation* creates pull requests for
developers to update to the recommended open source package with a single click.
 Merge Confidence* provides developers crowd
sourced statistics that indicate the likelihood that a dependency update will break their project.
 Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) tracks
components in the latest build of every version you deploy.
 Open source license compliance gives legal
teams visibility and control over open source license usage.
 Multiple SDLC integration points including the
browser, IDE, repository, package managers, build tools, CI servers and other AST tools.
 One-step repo integrations scan code
automatically and show results in near-real-time -- before developers have moved on to new tasks.

 Static code analysis identifies security weaknesses
in custom code. Detects over 70 CWE issues including OWASP Top 10 and SANS 25 in desktop, web and mobile applications.
 Automated remediation* creates pull requests for
developers to update their custom code to remove security flaws. Automatically generated recommendations are specific to each line of code, not generic examples.
 Broad support for 27 different programming
languages and various programming frameworks.
 Ultra-fast scanning engine* generates results
up to 10x faster than legacy SAST solutions.
 Super-easy integration with your existing
DevOps environment and CI/CD pipeline means developers don't need to manually configure or trigger the scan.
 Unified developer experience* inside the code
repository shows security alerts and remediation suggestions for custom code and open source code side-by-side.
 Feature branch scanning determines whether
recent code changes introduced new security issues.
