As organizations continue their journey towards cloud transformation and application modernization, they require modern security solutions that are both powerful and easy to operationalize. VMware Carbon Black Cloud WorkloadTM delivers advanced protection purpose-built for securing modern workloads to reduce the attack surface and strengthen security posture. This innovative solution combines prioritized vulnerability reporting and foundational workload hardening with industry-leading prevention, detection and response capabilities to protect workloads running in virtualized, private and hybrid cloud environments.
Tightly integrated with vSphere, VMware Carbon Black Cloud Workload provides agentless security that alleviates installation and management overhead and consolidates the collection of telemetry for multiple workload security use cases. This unified solution enables Security and Infrastructure teams to automatically secure new and existing workloads at every point in the security lifecycle, while simplifying operations and consolidating the IT and Security stack.
Identify risk and harden workloads
VMware Carbon Black Cloud Workload helps Security and Infrastructure teams focus on the most high-risk vulnerabilities and common exploits across their environments. It's not about finding the most vulnerabilities--it's about finding the right ones. Prioritize vulnerabilities based on a combination of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), real-life exploitability and frequency of attack and increase patching efficiency with best-in-class prioritization.

BENEFITS FOR SECURITY TEAMS  Protect workloads from known and
unknown attacks
 Reduce complexity by consolidating security tools
 Easily investigate security incidents
 Visualize attack chains in real time
 Faster mean time to resolution (MTTR)
 Remove barriers between security analysis and IT operations
 Engage with an active user community of internal security experts and peers

The real-time Vulnerability Assessment helps Security and Infrastructure teams understand vulnerability context with risk scores and links to the National Vulnerability Database, and eliminates the need for resource-heavy scans, with no additional administrative overhead or setup. VMware Carbon Black Cloud Workload also provides visibility into operations hygiene, indicators of compromise (IOCs), malicious tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and ordinary events that occur on the system.
vSphere Administrators can easily activate workload protection as a feature right from the vSphere Client, with bulk enablement and lifecycle management for virtual machine inventory. The vSphere dashboard provides visibility into appliance health, inventory status and install workflow, and allows the Infrastructure team to see a riskprioritized list of operating system and application vulnerabilities found across the environment. VMware Carbon Black Cloud Workload enables deeper, unparalleled visibility into your environment to reduce risk and harden workloads, while helping to streamline and operationalize security.
Prevent, detect and respond to advanced attacks
Security teams often lack visibility and control in highly dynamic virtualized data center environments. VMware Carbon Black Cloud Workload protects workloads running in these environments by combining foundational vulnerability assessment and workload hardening with industry leading next-generation antivirus (NGAV), workload behavioral monitoring, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) for workloads.
With advanced workload protection from VMware Carbon Black, the Security team can analyze attacker behavior patterns over time to detect and stop never-seenbefore attacks, including those manipulating known-good software. If an attacker bypasses perimeter defenses, VMware Carbon Black Cloud Workload empowers Security teams to shut down the attack before it escalates to a data breach. By embedding security into the infrastructure, you can easily audit current system state to track security posture and harden workloads, while enabling easier collaboration with vSphere Administrators to address known vulnerabilities.
Simplify operations for IT and security teams
At VMware, we are taking an intrinsic approach to delivering security--building it into the infrastructure everywhere workloads are deployed. Through this unique approach, we can eliminate the trade-off between security and operational simplicity by providing a single source of truth for Infrastructure and Security teams to accelerate response to critical vulnerabilities and attacks, while enabling collaboration and reducing friction. Simplify and consolidate your IT and security stack by replacing multiple point security tools that compete for resources with VMware Carbon Black Cloud Workload.
