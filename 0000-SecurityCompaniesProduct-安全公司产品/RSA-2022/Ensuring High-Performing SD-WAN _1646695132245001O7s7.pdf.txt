SD-WAN Optimization
Application Performance and Security Validation

CyPerf

Keysight's CyPerf is the world's first agent-based test solution that recreates every aspect of a realistic workload across a variety of physical and cloud environments to deliver insights into end user quality of experience (QoE), security posture, and performance bottlenecks of distributed networks. With CyPerf, organizations validate software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN) solutions and the bandwidth performance and QoE of various SD-WAN topologies, along with security efficacy of SD-WAN security offerings.

Challenges of Creating Resilient, High-Performing, and Secure SD-WANs

 Ensuring smooth deployment of SD-WAN infrastructure over complex topologies like physically distributed branches, clouds, and datacenters
 Validating SD-WAN performance in highly dynamic conditions that include cloud and hardware variables
 Measuring key performance indicators, latencies, and quality of experience of the SD-WAN tunnels as they spread across wide area networks
 Maintaining resiliency of SD-WAN tunnels to debug and remediate tunnel disappearance, flapping and other inconsistencies rampant in this environment

 Understanding the efficacy of SD-WAN security offerings and striking a right balance of performance and security features

CyPerf--Your Solution to Ensuring High-Performing SD-WANs

 Validate security features like application profiling and blocking, malware mitigation, exploit detection and block, URL filtering, file inspection

 Generate both application and attack traffic to accurately evaluate the performance cost of security features strike a right balance with QoE
 Conduct relevant demos and proof of concepts and verify service-level agreements
 Optimize SD-WAN deployments using distributed CyPerf test agents deployed in physical and cloud exchanging application traffic between them
 Evaluate key performance indicators of SD-WAN tunnels and understand maximum and average latencies, concurrency, and throughput
