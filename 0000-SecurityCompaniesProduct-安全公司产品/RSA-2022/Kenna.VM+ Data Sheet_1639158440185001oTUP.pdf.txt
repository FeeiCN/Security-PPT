Kenna.VI+
A Vulnerability Intel API to Enhance Your VM Workflows

KENNA.VI+ (Vulnerability Intel Plus) gives security teams access to the industry's richest consolidation of vulnerability intel via an API. Kenna.VI+ incorporates rich CVE data from more than 18 threat and exploit intel feeds, including customcurated sources. Organizations can access these records via an API to use within their existing vulnerability management (VM) workflows, or they can search and review CVE data within a user interface (UI).
World-Class CVE Enrichment for Security Alerts, Vulnerability Scans, and CI/CD Pipelines
Kenna.VI+ lets organizations query and export actionable information from a multitude of detailed attributes for any CVE, including descriptions, publication dates, Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) data, available exploits, available fixes, if the vulnerability is exploitable by a remote code execution, list of vulnerable products, and much more. Also provided is a Kenna Risk Score and intel on predicted exploitability for each vulnerability--unique data points derived by Kenna's advanced data science.

Benefits
 Enhance Your Security Research: Query and export individual records to understand how attackers can exploit CVEs in the real world and inform your defense measures. A Postman library is available to streamline getting access to the data.
 Enrich Your Vulnerability Data: Overlay your existing data sources with Kenna's unique vulnerability intel to add additional context around CVEs.
 Make Your VM Platform Smarter: Integrate Kenna's vulnerability intelligence into any VM workflow and maximize the ROI of your existing VM solution deployment(s).
 Built-In Data Science: View Kenna Risk Score and predicted exploitability of a CVE--unique data points derived from Kenna's machine learning-- for a greater level of vulnerability insight and prioritization.
