Preventing Cyber Attacks in the Public Sector

Executive Overview
The public sector has been relatively untouched by financially motivated cybercriminals, with organizations within the sector primarily being the target of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups conducting nation-state cyber activities. But times have changed, the everincreasing blurred line between nation-state and financially motivated cybercriminals. Global government organizations have become more vulnerable to a wide variety of cyberattacks.
Digital transformation and the implementation of new technology have created vast amounts of valuable data held electronically, such as personally identifiable information (PII) and confidential and/or sensitive documents. Additional data specific to critical infrastructure, judicial system(s), public transportation, and electoral systems are high value targets to financially motivated criminals given the high profitability these stolen digital assets offer in the underground market.
In this whitepaper, we will not only share what the Public Sector can do to prevent and protect their organizations, we will dissect the Colonial Pipeline case study and surface lessons to be learned. This includes application of the U.S. Executive Order addressing Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity, which was released on May 12, 2021, not even one week after the Colonial Pipeline attack. The order frames the value Intel 471 brings to the Public Sector, and ultimately how Intel 471 can help the Federal Government improve its efforts to identify, deter, protect against, detect, and respond to these actions and actors who jeopardize the American people's security and privacy.

Know the Enemy
What is commonly referred to as the deep and dark web is quite the opposite, it is not deep... and it is certainly not dark. As such, Intel 471 refers to this as The Cyber Underground, an ecosystem made up of a plethora of actors providing or acquiring products, goods and services. Preventing attacks begins with gaining an understanding of these cybercriminals, their environment and their buying and selling behaviors. Below are several definitions that will guide you through several Public Sector examples.
· Products are defined as something that was created or refined for sale to be used for
further fraudulent activity such as phishing pages, vulnerabilities and exploits.
· Goods are defined as a commodity for sale, usually perpetuated by products created
in the underground. For example, phishing pages may have gleaned compromised corporate credentials which will be offered for sale or may have been used to retrieve data from a business, which may also be offered for sale.
· Services are defined as organized systems that provide accommodations required by
the underground community. This sometimes requires membership payment and can include version update offers and more. One example of this is Malware-as-aService (MaaS), such as Emotet, a modular loader that could steal credentials and other information from infected users, as well as distribute other malware. However, an everincreasing form of MaaS is ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), enabling users to conduct ransomware attacks against organizations through an `affiliate' program with a portion of profits given to the ransomware gang.
Threat actors seek to compromise businesses in varying ways ranging from access merchants seeking to gain initial entry to a network to ransomware operators who seek to identify data of interest before encrypting it, deploying their ransomware, and holding the victim to ransom.
Intel 471 continuously monitors this ecosystem of underground actors and has an in-depth understanding of their operations and how they interact with one another. Our coverage and expertise empower our clients to stay aware of actors seeking to compromise Public Sector entities or attempting to sell access to and/or data from them on a global scale. For example, on September 02, 2021, our Intelligence Team detected an underground actor attempting to sell sensitive documents relating to government and security forces from a country external to the U.S. Previously, in July 2021 our team detected yet another underground actor attempting to sell Virtual Private Network (VPN) access to an agency of another external country's government.

institutions, Intel 471 can help the governments safeguard the security and privacy of its citizens by staying ahead of the curve and proactively preparing for and dealing with similar threats.
Our team has also detected several financially motivated threat actors targeting U.S. government institutions, such as on June 09, 2021, our team observed a known trader of sensitive military and government data, offering to sell documents allegedly belonging to the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). However, through our use of the Admiralty/NATO Intelligence Evaluation System we were able to grade this as C (Fairly Reliable) 5 (Improbable), as it was unlikely that the actor had specific sensitive information mentioned in their advertisement but has been observed selling similar data in the past. Furthermore, through our use of the Admiralty Evaluation System this enables our clients to understand the accuracy of reported information and our Intelligence Team to conduct further investigations if necessary.
We have also detected several other incidents impacting organizations across the Public Sector, which include:
· Supply Chain Attacks · Compromised data being offered for sale and sold · Compromised network access being offered for sale and sold · Compromised credentials · Hacktivism · Ransomware
Intel 471 provides comprehensive coverage and monitoring of the Cyber Underground (including the Deep and Dark Web) to provide in-depth visibility into threats that Public Sector organizations may face.

Operationalize Our Intelligence
Alongside the use of the Admiralty System, Intel 471's operations are built on the Intelligence Cycle.
DIRECTION
Our customers outline their key risks and areas of key concern to them, or their third parties to Intel 471. Using our Cyber Underground: General Intelligence Requirements (GIR) baseline tool, our client's team and our boots-on-the-ground research teams organize, prioritize, and produce cyber underground intelligence relevant information for
collection.

DISSEMINATION
The intelligence analysis conducted is packaged up into a variety of products ranging from Finished Intelligence (FINTEL), Information Reports (IRs) and even MITRE ATT&CK Navigator JSON files which can
be downloaded and used by our clients.

COLLECTION
Through our customers' risks and our GIRs, our teams collect valuable information using a plethora of resources at their disposal to provide
valuable and timely information.

ANALYSIS
Our Intelligence Team analyse the collected information outlining what the risk is to our customers based on our Direction, and curate thorough intelligence assessments using predictive analysis to forewarn and safeguard our clients. Moreover, our team integrates their findings with MITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques to provide an in-depth evaluation of the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) being used by threat actors throughout the underground ecosystem.

Human Intelligence (HUMINT) -- The Intel 471 Boots on The Ground Model
While the intelligence cycle is integral to our operations, our Human Intelligence (HUMINT) capability provides in-depth context and insights that are not available by other means. Anyone can verify claims from threat actors; however, our teams take this one step further. Through their intricate knowledge of threat actors and access into closed parts of the cyber underground, our teams can glean crucial information by speaking not just the native language of the threat actor, but also the language of a cybercriminal. This enables us to gather vital intelligence for our clients such as:
· Adversary Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) · Malware/tooling/infrastructure · Tactics & capabilities · Targets & motivation(s) · Context & relationships among actors, groups
The breadth and depth of our HUMINT was highlighted in early 2021, when our boots on the ground team observed an actor posting on a closed Russian forum, offering network access with administrator privileges to a European-based organization within the financial space. This specific actor was known to our team, and we had been tracking the actor for some time. As a result, we were able to gather evidence which verified the actor did indeed have network access with administrator privileges. However, as mentioned above, verification is only the beginning.
The team continued to investigate this claim and due to our extensive knowledge of the actor from previous HUMINT investigations, we were able to understand how the actor gained this access and that they planned on targeting other organizations across Europe in a similar way. Acknowledging that they had future targets of interest, further investigations were conducted to safeguard our wider client base. Our Intelligence Team curated a Finished Intelligence (FINTEL) product to support the notification. This FINTEL report provided MITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques and in-depth TTPs used by the threat actor for not only the awareness of the impacted party, but also our other clients. This provided information such as:
· How the actor obtained the access they are trying to sell · What account had been compromised

· Where were they were selling the access and what other types of threat actors use this
closed Russian forum
· The links to other actors who may have purchased this access offered
This timely and accurate information from our HUMINT team not only enabled the affected organization to prevent this access being exploited by more malicious actors such as ransomware operators, but also provided our wider client base with information on how they could protect themselves.

Case Study: Early Warning Solar Winds and Colonial Pipeline

The U.S. has been heavily impacted by cybercriminal activity, a trend which is highly likely to continue. This is due to many highly profitable businesses being located within the country and the desire for threat actors to cause disruption for political, financial or personal motives.

While businesses across the country are of interest to underground criminal actors seeking

to turn a quick profit. It is also probable that these underground criminal actors also seek to

target government entities or critical national infrastructure (CNI)

-- either directly in the case of Colonial Pipeline or indirectly

through third parties such as SolarWinds. Access to CNI or thirdparty suppliers of government organizations will almost certainly gather significant interest from the underground criminal community and in turn substantial profits for threat actors quickly.

Supply chain attacks are common among state-sponsored entities and often

credential misuse. This fact, combined with the plethora of

publicly available exploits for SolarWinds software, likely made it

an attractive target for attackers. Supply chain attacks are common among state-sponsored

entities and often are difficult to prevent, emphasizing the need for strong password policies

and profiling of public-facing systems and third-party software. The key to defend against

such a determined and well-resourced adversary always is to apply the principle of "least

privilege" to all systems and services.

access to Colonial Pipeline through compromised credentials. This is a common TTP used by

a wide variety of underground cybercriminals. Attackers usually purchase access credentials

on underground forums, conduct brute-force attacks, use spam campaigns to spread

malware loaders and buy access to popular botnets such as Dridex, TrickBot and ZLoader.

As for post-exploitation techniques, the arsenal of a regular

Critical National Infrastructure can be astronomical.

The impact caused by ransomware operators attacking CNI and third parties can be astronomical, as seen from the Colonial Pipeline and SolarWinds incidents. These attacks are unlikely to subside in the near-term, especially while organizations continue to pay millions of dollars in ransom.

Subsequently, it is likely that these attacks will increase over

the next 6-12 months and the U.S. will likely remain the most impacted region globally for

some time. With both businesses and government entities being in the sights of prominent

ransomware operations such as Avaddon, Conti and Darkside. Nevertheless, intelligence

provided by Intel 471 can help you stay ahead of the curve and prevent your adversaries from

conducting successful attacks against; you, CNI, or third parties that you work alongside.

Intel 471 provides a variety of solutions teams can leverage to maintain visibility into underground threat actors' activity and the methodologies they implement, including insight into their operations via our Adversary Intelligence, monitoring for compromised credentials via our Credentials Intelligence, malware coverage via our Malware Intelligence and patch prioritization via our Vulnerability Dashboard.

Adversary Intelligence
Adversary Intelligence provides proactive and groundbreaking insights into the methodology of top-tier cybercriminals ­ target selection, assets and tools used, associates and other enablers that support them. Intel 471's field driven collection and headquarters-based analysis directly supports the intelligence needs across an organization spanning your security, executive, vulnerability, risk, investigation, and fraud teams. Access finished intelligence or leverage the underlying and raw collection; the choice is there for you to

leverage the best option for your organization. We provide deliverables for multiple teams and maturity levels.
Credential Intelligence
Intel 471's automated collection systems and global "boots on the ground" Intel team constantly collects compromised credential data and produces unique intelligence. Our compromised credential database contains billions of credentials and tens of millions of other unique data points that provide valuable context. Linking and pivoting across credential releases and into our intelligence knowledge base is as simple as a click. This context is key as actors often combine many older releases into larger data sets and attempt to trade or sell them as well. This causes confusion and extra cycles to be spent tracking down stale data. Credential Intelligence allows you to differentiate between freshly compromised credentials and old repackaged data. While the news, blogs, and other vendors are sounding the alarm at the next billion-record data breach, you can rest easy knowing it's simply stale data repackaged and re-released. Or you can act quickly when you are alerted to a fresh credential set when it hits the marketplace for the first time.
BENEFITS OF CREDENTIAL INTELLIGENCE
Intel 471's complete coverage across the underground marketplace offers our clients the ability to be proactive by monitoring and mitigating the risk associated with compromised credentials as they hit the marketplace. Credential Intelligence satisfies four core-use cases associated with compromised credentials:
· Employees: Know when your employee accounts have been compromised and stop
ATO and other types of malicious activity.
· VIPs: Proactively monitor and protect accounts of executives and key personnel before
those key accounts are used as a launching point.
· Customers: Alert your own customers to malware infections associated with their online
accounts using your services.
· Third-party relationships: Know when your third-party vendors and suppliers have
exposure that, by extension, introduces unnecessary risk to your business.

Malware Intelligence
At the core of Malware Intelligence is our unique and patented Malware Emulation and Tracking System (METS) that provides ongoing surveillance of malware activity at the command-and-control level thus delivering near real-time insights and deep context in support of numerous cyber security and intelligence use-cases, such as:
· Security Operations (NOC/SOC) · Threat Hunting · Incident Response · Campaign Tracking · 3rd-party Supplier and Vendor Risk
Whether you need high-fidelity Indicators of Compromise (IOCS) streaming to your SIEM and firewalls, track individual spam campaigns as they are executed or hunt for the precursors of a ransomware scenario, Malware Intelligence can help you start the shift towards a proactive and intelligence led cyber security posture.
Vulnerability Management and Patching
Intel 471's Vulnerability Intelligence is made to provide both relevant and timely intelligence information about the adversary scenario and address the gap in current vulnerability offerings, which focus mainly on existing exploits based on known attacks and open source information. Our Vulnerability Intelligence closes this gap by including the precursors to such activity such as an increase in interest levels amongst threat actors, proof-of-concept (POC) code being developed, traded, or sold, and ultimately the weaponization and productization of the code as it gets integrated into exploit kits, exploit packs or other tools. This activity often takes place prior to attacks being observed in the wild and being alerted enables a more proactive approach to vulnerability management.
Focus on the Precursors of Exploitation
Intel 471's Vulnerability Intelligence focuses on the precursors to exploitation of vulnerabilities in the wild via a regularly updated dashboard that tracks the life cycle of significant vulnerabilities observed in the underground from initial disclosure to exploit weaponization and productization. Vulnerability Intelligence offers an analyst-driven assessment of priority vulnerabilities beyond volumetric keyword hits, which just isn't adequate in today's cyber security environment, especially when protecting government organizations and CNI.

Precursors to exploitation include:
· Vulnerability publicized and patches released · Threat actor interest levels start to orient toward specific vulnerabilities · Proof-of-Concept (POC) code is made availability amongst cybercriminals and
researchers
· Weaponization is observed as exploits are bought and employed · Productization occurs as exploits are integrated into products lowering the barrier to
exploitation significantly
Intelligence Platform
Intel 471's TITAN platform and data model offers users to easily search, pivot and mine through a large dataset of threat intelligence and raw data. Our monitoring and alerting system can be used to alert on new activity in near real-time. The RESTful API and numerous integrations supports seamless ingestion into Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs), Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, and other third-party platforms and security tooling.
We provide our customers with an unparalleled global intelligence capability. We can help the public sector defend against threats with better insights and tools than you've ever had before -- enabling the sector to meet the requirements outlined in the Executive Order and protect the American people's security and privacy.
