ALGOSEC OBJECTFLOW NETWORK SECURITY OBJECT MANAGEMENT MADE SIMPLE

Managing firewall objects across your hybrid network is difficult. A disorderly network may have multiple firewall objects covering the same data, duplicate objects, or even unattached objects. These issues slow down changes to network connectivity and security policies, increasing the risk of misconfigurations, outages, and even security breaches.
With ObjectFlow, network security object management becomes a breeze. Manage firewall and SDN objects in a central place, to avoid duplication, errors, and mismatches -- ensuring that you can securely accelerate application delivery.

Manage network security objects across your entire multi-vendor network
FROM OBJECT DISCOVERY TO COMPLETE OBJECT VISIBILITY: Tap into all your SDN and firewalls to automatically discover all the objects on your network and manage them in a central place -- ensuring complete object visibility.
Once objects are discovered, ensure that they are clean and organized. ObjectFlow identifies unattached objects and finds duplicate objects, including those with mismatched naming conventions. Use ObjectFlow to streamline and create unified naming conventions -- even between vendors.
AUTOMATE OBJECT CHANGES: Automate object changes from a central location. Reduce reliance on your security team while avoiding manual configurations by pushing changes directly to the firewall objects.
With ObjectFlow, you can even migrate object definitions between firewalls to facilitate fast and easy migrations and upgrades.
REDUCE RISK: By knowing what each of your network objects is and managing them in a single place, easily identify risky objects, so you know exactly what needs changing.

Key Business Benefits
 Securely accelerate application delivery.  Change objects in minutes instead of days.  Obtain full visibility and uniformity over your network
security objects.  Break down organizational silos and increase alignment
among IT and security teams.  Prevent outages and misconfigurations.
