Overview
Continuous Validation with Automated Attacks; Detailed Steps to Resolve and Lock Down Vulnerabilities
The digital transformation of worldwide economic, business and government operations has seen rapid growth in security defense technologies such as encryption, Nextgen firewalls, filtering methods, malware screening, multi-factor authentication, and surveillance.
Despite advances in these defensive technologies, networks, hosts and applications are continuously under attack by increasingly creative and sophisticated methods. Breaches are continually growing in number, size, and the damage inflicted by the attackers.
Industry Trends
Traditional defensive security mechanisms have failed to adequately protect networks, data centers, hosts, and applications from infiltration, attacks, and breaches. The effectiveness of traditional defensive security mechanisms pivots mainly on the concept of border security--while increasingly, industry trends in SaaS, IaaS, cloud computing, IoT, virtualization, and mobility have blurred or erased borders in networks and computer processing and storage systems.
Security posture is also distressed because, while attacks have escalated in number, subtlety, and precision, IT resources for security measures, audits, and protective activities, have tightened.

RidgeBot does much more than a pen-test: it auto-discovers assets and then proceeds to probe them continuously, iteratively, fully automated, at scale, and exploits the vulnerabilities found. In its report, it alerts you to the ranked short-list of dangerous, successfully exploited vulnerabilities as well as a list of lower-priority non-exploited vulnerabilities. Your network is always locked down, always patch-up to date, always ready for audit, and always ready to submit proof of security posture--all at minimal cost and human intervention.
RidgeBot provides the following key capabilities:
 Discovery: Automatically crawls through your environment to identify and document types of assets (including networks, hosts, applications, plug-ins, images, IoT devices, and mobile devices) and the attack surfaces of those assets.
 Scanning: Assets and attack surfaces are mined for vulnerabilities by leveraging RidgeSecurity's leading-edge Threat Intelligence Platform--a collective vulnerability knowledge database--that includes more than 2-billion pieces of security intelligence data, 100 million attack libraries, and 150K exploit libraries.
 Exploit: AI/ML-assisted attack techniques/modes automatically exploit vulnerabilities found. Findings are documented along with remediation recommendations in accurate, reliable, and usable reports. AI/ML algorithms draw on an expert knowledge base guides RidgeBot in attackpath-finding and path-selection. They launch iterative attacks based on learning along the path and achieve much broader test coverage and more in-depth inspection than traditional pen-test methods.
 Post-exploit Risk Prioritization: RidgeBot visualizes the kill-chain and quantifies risks based on multiple factors, giving organizations detailed and specific rankings of the most dangerous vulnerabilities. Focusing on specific exploitable vulnerabilities (a single-digit percentage), RidgeBot's analytics drastically reduce the manual work required to rank and remediate vulnerabilities.

ISO 2700 Overview
The ISO 27000 family of standards offers a set of specifications, codes of conduct, and best-practice guidelines for organizations to ensure strong information security management. ISO/IEC 27001:2013, superseding ISO/IEC 27001:2005, specifies the best practices to implement and maintain an Information Security Management system (ISMS): a systematic approach to securely managing data and includes people, processes, and technology.
ISO 27001 is a technology-neutral security management standard that prescribes the attributes of an effective ISMS. ISO 27002--an essential supplementary piece to the standard--details the best practices to implement an effective ISMS.
Type of Requirement: ISO 27001 is an information security industry standard. It is not a legal requirement, but certification is often a prerequisite for contracts or conducting business with government entities, government-funded entities, or large corporate clients.
Geographic Applicability: Worldwide.
Ownership: Published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) (an international management and business continuity standards organization with representatives from 165 national standards organizations) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) (an international standards organization for electrical, electronic and related technologies).
Compliance Verification and Enforcement: Companies achieve certification with ISO 27001 by preparing for compliance. Then companies must schedule an audit with a national accreditation body that is a member of the International Accreditation Forum (IAF). The ANSI National Accreditation Board (ANAB) is in the US, or the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) is in the UK. Certified companies participate annually in an external review process and must recertify every three years to maintain compliance.

Implementation of an ISO 27001-compliant ISMS is a multi-step process, broadly following this outline:
 Governance: This requires a demonstrated top management commitment to an ISMS.
 Risk Assessment: Requires exact understanding of the risks to information security faced by the organization.
 Documentation: Sets out how the ISMS works.
 Continual improvement: Once the ISMS is implemented, performance and effectiveness must be measured, deviations must be identified, and corrective action must be taken.
Several supplementary standards contribute to the interpretation and implementation of ISO 27001.
 ISO 27002 recommends best practices for effective implementation of the ISO 27001 specifications.
 ISO 27005 guides information security risk management.
 ISO 27017 focuses on how the ISO 27001 controls apply to information stored in the cloud.
 ISO 27018 offers guidance on protecting sensitive information in the cloud.
 ISO 27701 defines additional ISMS requirements to cover data privacy, recognizing that information security is essential to effective privacy management. It was created in response to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to detail how ISO 27001 controls intersect with data privacy.

Continuous Security Validation
 RidgeBot provides no-cost iterative, continuous hardening, and asset inventory. You can run different scans periodically or continuously--because it is fully automated, no manual intervention is required until a vulnerability is reported.

 Continuous monitoring and asset discovery protect against hacker intrusion caused by an employee (or any other person) accidentally or maliciously connecting untrusted or unplanned IoT, wireless, or other unauthorized devices to the environment.

 Scan reports provide a shortlist of must-fix exploitable vulnerabilities to document and resolve. Report output ensures all software patches and updates needed to resolve dangerous vulnerabilities are installed on all affected assets.

DevOps/SecOps Software Development and Release Testing
 Use RidgeBot during software development to ensure that dangerous coding practices introducing vulnerabilities never ship in new software releases.

 Use RidgeBot to harden software patches, software upgrades, new devices, and any configuration changes before pushing them into the production environment.

Security Posture Validation  Continuously iteratively attack the production environment to maintain security posture. Discover
misconfigurations in wireless or defensive security appliances or services such as firewall rules or UTM appliances.
 Continuously monitor and harden login credentials on sensitive assets.
Compliance Audit  Continuous asset discovery scanning and attack and exploitation attempts (and the reports
issued) mean your environment is always audit-ready.
 RidgeBot reports submit evidence of vulnerabilities probed, remediated, and resolved.
Security Incident Response  Scan reports containing recommended solutions for each vulnerability found and provide critical
information to your security incident response/escalation team.
 Risk ranking of vulnerabilities feeds into the priorities and procedures for incident response.
 RidgeBot AI/ML exploitation attacks provide forensic capabilities to investigate the origin and path taken by a breach and step-by-step guidance on how to resolve the entry point vulnerability.
RidgeBot includes several template scans and the flexibility to completely customize your scans. The system templates include:
 Full scan: This test launches numerous attack techniques used by real-world hackers. Based on threat intelligence and an exploit knowledge base, RidgeBot profiles assets, mines vulnerabilities, and launches attacks against target assets, which may be internal or external to your environment, in a private or public environment.
 Weak password scan: This test launches direct or iterative attacks based on sensitive information collected via weak credential or unauthorized access vulnerabilities. Attack targets include Redis, Elasticsearch, ActiveMQ, database, web login, and other applications.
 Struts 2 scan: This test launches direct or iterative attacks based on known 1-day or n-day vulnerabilities detected on targets using the Struts 2 framework.
 Weblogic scan: This test launches direct or iterative attacks based on known 1-day or n-day vulnerabilities detected on targets using Weblogic middleware.
 Web scan: This test launches cyberattacks against target websites, web applications, and all related attack surfaces to gain control of the target website for both self-developed and contact management system-based websites.
 Host scan: This test launches direct or iterative attacks from inside a corporate network to validate the security system's response to an internal threat. Target systems include all networkaccessible internal hosts and servers.

HOW RIDGEBOT CAN HELP
ISO 27001 Implementation and Certification
RidgeBot can help in many ways with specific implementation stages, implementation challenges, and ongoing maintenance of ISO 27001 Certification, Audit, and Review.
 Asset Identification: ISO 27001 requires that several classes of assets be inventoried, including digital records, IT assets, business applications, and mobile devices.
RidgeBot's automated asset discovery can help inventory all assets while preparing for an ISO 27001 [re]certification. It can additionally verify that no new, unplanned devices are connected to the infrastructure that introduces vulnerabilities on an ongoing basis. For example, an attacker might set up a rogue wireless access point or install an IoT device that allows remote access to the internal network.
 Risk Assessment: ISO 27001 requires you to conduct regular risk assessments. The standard stipulates that your risk assessment process must produce "consistent, valid, and comparable results"--the stages of risk assessment involve Identifying, Analyzing, and Evaluating risks. Furthermore, ISO 27001 states that once all risks are identified, each risk must be individually assessed as to the likelihood of exploitation, the harm that could occur. A rank or score must be assigned to each vulnerability by the risk criteria.
RidgeBot's pen-test capabilities identify, analyze, and evaluate all risks found. Additionally, it exploits risks found and provides remedial steps. The scan reports provide a ranked list of vulnerabilities found based on each vulnerability's likelihood to be exploited, including those that were successfully exploited during the test. The reports also provide an evaluation with granular steps to remediate each vulnerability. The RidgeBot scan reports provide a vehicle to comply with the "consistent, valid, and comparable results" requirement of ISO 27001.
 Risk Treatment Plan: ISO 27001 states that your Risk Treatment Plan must determine the "methods for monitoring, measurement, analysis, and evaluation [...] to ensure valid results". The effectiveness of about half of the controls listed in ISO 27001 Annex A can only be sufficiently evaluated using penetration testing.
RidgeBot's fully automated pen-test capabilities can be run cost-effectively as frequently as necessary, rather than hiring a consulting firm to do a one-time test. Peace of mind is ensured that your assets are continually locked-down. New vulnerabilities are detected immediately after--or often before--introduced into your production environment. Your business environment is always compliant with ISO 27001, not just when you prepare for an audit, a review, or recertification.

ISO27001 Compliance White Paper 10

 Documentation: An arduous aspect of an ISO 27001 ISMS implementation is developing the Standard's documentation explicitly required.
RidgeBot's scan reports (results from the same scan repeat on a fixed schedule) can assist in compiling "consistent, valid and comparable" documentation of vulnerabilities found, vulnerability ranking, successful exploits, and mitigation and remedial steps are taken.
 Continual Improvement through Measurement, Monitoring, and Review: This aspect of ISO 27001 requires that your ISMS is continually analyzed and reviewed for performance, effectiveness, compliance, and identifying process improvements.
RidgeBot's scan reports--run continually or periodically--can assist in providing reports and recommended remedial steps providing the evidence the Standard requires to show that risks are being adequately found, measured, reviewed, and treated.
A penetration testing service that regularly tests the ISO 27001 controls and, when necessary, test changes to IT and security infrastructure is a fundamental part of any continuous improvement process.
RidgeBot provides this service at a very cost-effective price-point. It is fully automated. Scans can be scheduled as often as needed (fulfilling the "internal audit" ISO 27001 requirement). RidgeBot scan output provides consistent and comparable reports, including quantitative measurements (vulnerability categories and rankings) that demonstrate your ISMS's effectiveness.
