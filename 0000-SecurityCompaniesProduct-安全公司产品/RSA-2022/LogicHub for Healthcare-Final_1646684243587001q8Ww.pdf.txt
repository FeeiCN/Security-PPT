Solution Brief

LogicHub for Healthcare Organizations
Automation-driven managed detection and response

Healthcare providers, insurers and business associates are among the most targeted organizations for attempted data theft. According to industry research from Ponemon and Protenus, healthcare organizations are impacted more than other industries. Key statistics include:  $7.13 million average cost of a breach vs $3.86 million overall
 $429 per healthcare record vs $146 across all industries
 187 days to discover a breach at a healthcare organization
And yet despite the need for a strong cybersecurity program, healthcare organizations typically have lower budgets and struggle to retain skilled resources. But you're still expected to deliver the same or better level of security, including:
 Continuous monitoring for compliance and security
 24x7 protection from advanced threats like ransomware
 Strict adherence to data protection and breach reporting
But without the resources to fully staff and operate a 24x7 enterprise SOC, it's difficult for your team to build an effective security operations program and keep up with the overwhelming volume of potential threats and associated alerts on your own.

What You Need  Cost effective, 24x7 protection from
advanced threats
 Continuous monitoring of cloud, endpoint, network and user related log and event data
 Formal incident response processes that meet your specific requirements
What LogicHub Delivers  24x7 expert detection and response
services mapped to MITRE ATT&CK
 Custom playbooks and processes built to meet your individual operating requirements and protect ePHI
