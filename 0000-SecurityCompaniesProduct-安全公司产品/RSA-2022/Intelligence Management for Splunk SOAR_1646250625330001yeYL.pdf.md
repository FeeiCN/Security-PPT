Intelligence Management for Splunk SOAR
Accelerated response through priority scoring

The Problem
Analysts are burdened with an onslaught of security alerts, disparate data scoring and too many repetitive, manual security tasks. Phishing continues to be one of the most pervasive threats that organizations face and was present in 36% of breaches (compared to 25% last year). As a result, much of an analyst's time is spent manually reviewing and triaging phishing emails and other events, which takes time away from priority alerts and mission-critical objectives.
Splunk Intelligence Management for Splunk SOAR
Splunk SOAR automatically analyzes and responds to security use cases using automated playbooks. But Splunk SOAR playbooks become even more powerful with the addition of Splunk Intelligence Management (formerly TruSTAR). With Splunk Intelligence Management, you can take advantage of the following capabilities to bolster your automation and response within Splunk SOAR.
Enhanced phishing triage flows
Splunk Intelligence Management ingests user-reported suspicious emails, extracts observables and enriches them with open source, commercial intelligence feeds, and internal historical data. Splunk Intelligence Management then calculates a normalized score for each Indicator and applies a priority score to each email for automated or manual response within Splunk SOAR.

Investigation enrichment for rapid manual response
Splunk Intelligence Management enriches and scores indicators with open source, commercial intelligence feeds, and internal historical data to provide deeper context and intelligence. The Splunk SOAR Threat Investigate playbook natively incorporates Splunk Intelligence Management via the built-in TruSTAR Enrich Indicators playbook. Indicators are passed from Splunk SOAR to Splunk Intelligence Management for enrichment, which is then captured in the notes of a container. Within a single prompt, analysts can view indicator enrichment details and specify subsequent response actions directly in Splunk SOAR, eliminating the need to pivot between security tools.

Indicator enrichment and priority scoring for improved automated response
Splunk Intelligence Management integrates with a number of premium intelligence sources as well as open source feeds. Each of those sources calculates scores for events and indicators in their own unique way. Splunk Intelligence Management aggregates, normalizes, and prioritizes intelligence across all of your subscribed sources by applying an indicator priority score. Splunk SOAR playbooks can be simplified by calling Splunk Intelligence Management for indicator enrichment from all of your intelligence sources. Instead of having to build a playbook that aggregates intelligence from all of your intelligence sources separately, the aggregated priority score from Splunk Intelligence Management can be used to automate actions.

Original Indicator Scores
 Source A: High  Source B: 89 out of 100  Source C: 5 out of 10  Source D: Unknown

Normalized Scoring*
 High
*Splunk Intelligence Management normalizes original indicator scores using the following scale: Unkown, Benign, Low, Medium, High
