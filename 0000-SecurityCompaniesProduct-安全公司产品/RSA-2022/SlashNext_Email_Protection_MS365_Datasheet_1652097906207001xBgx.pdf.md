Email Protection
Detect and remove targeted spear phishing, social engineering, rogueware, scam, bank fraud and data exploit threats that easily evade your Microsoft 365 email security defenses.

Powerful, Simple, Secure, Fast ROI
Now organizations can leverage SlashNext's award-winning AI threat detection to securely detect and remove targeted spear-phishing and other human threats that easily evade email security defenses.
Current email defenses, including Microsoft 365 built-in security, miss up to 65% of targeted spear phishing, social engineering, business email compromise (BEC), and other malicious digital user attacks launched from legitimate, trusted sites. Targeted, well-crafted spear-phishing continues to rise dramatically in an environment where cybercriminals use automation and AI to increase the likelihood of compromising a target. The once-reliable security strategies of Secure Email Gateways (SEGs), proxy/SASE, and endpoint protections cannot safeguards against rapidly evolving phishing tactics. Spear-phishing delivered through legitimate cloud services can bypass traditional cybersecurity solutions. Since these attacks focus on a person, not the technology, success rates are higher, providing the attacker a lower-cost entry point into an organization.
With SlashNext's AI-based email protection continuously detects and remediate spear phishing threats missed by Microsoft Defender, ATPs and relationship graph technologies with 99.9% detection rate and 1 in 1M FPs. Organizations can detect these targeted attacks with pinpoint accuracy and remove them from individual infected user inboxes with one click. Leverage SlashNext's patented SEERTM AI to detect and remove attacks that easily evade relationship graphs, URL rewriting, and sandbox email security technologies.

Harness the Power of Real-Time with SEERTM AI
SlashNext's patented behavioral phishing detection technology uses millions of virtual browsers to detect unknown threats with unmatched accuracy. SEERTM (Session Emulation and Environment Reconnaissance) is a scalable, cloudbased threat detection technology that uses computer vision, NLP, and OCR, to dynamically inspect page contents and server behavior. Sophisticated machine learning algorithms and virtual browsers perform rich analysis to accurately detect zero-hour phishing threats and numerous enrichment artifacts.
This unique combination of techniques sees through evasion tactics and accurately detects phishing pages, even those hosted on compromised websites and legitimate infrastructure. It also follows through on all URL re-directs and performs run-time analysis on the final page of multi-stage threats.
