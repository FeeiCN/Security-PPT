THE EMERGENCE OF THE CYBER ASSET ATTACK SURFACE MANAGEMENT CATEGORY
WHAT IT MEANS
AND WHY IT MATTERS

Four years after Axonius created the term cybersecurity asset management to explain a new approach to understanding assets and their security and management coverage, analyst firm Gartner coined the term cyber asset attack surface management (CAASM).
This ebook will bring you through the emergence of the CAASM category, what it means, and why it matters.

FROM ASSET MANAGEMENT TO ASSET INTELLIGENCE: CROSSING THE CAASM

When a company introduces something innovative, they face a choice: Position the new product within an existing, established category -- or create something new.
In 2017, the Axonius team had a decision to make.

WHAT'S IN A NAME? CYBERSECURITY ASSET MANAGEMENT

THE GENESIS

Despite having some of the most sophisticated tools on the planet to protect against, detect, and remediate threats and vulnerabilities, security teams struggled to answer basic questions.
 How many Windows devices are in my environment?
 Are all my virtual machines (VMs) being scanned?  Which of my cloud workloads are misconfigured?  Are my agents deployed and working correctly?  Do my users have the correct permissions?
Years ago, answering these questions was simple. Organizations had Windows machines on a physical network, managed by Active Directory, protected by an antivirus (AV), and used something to push out updates.
But as time went on, different device types emerged -- like VMs, Macs, and Linux boxes. And with the advent of mobile devices, we implemented different solutions to manage and secure these various devices. Businesses moved to the cloud, bringing new types of security and management solutions. And now, in the era of IoT, everything that can be connected is connected.

FROM ASSET MANAGEMENT TO ASSET INTELLIGENCE: CROSSING THE CAASM

THE GENESIS

The increase in the number and diversity of devices -- coupled with the increase in tools used to secure and manage them -- made it difficult to answer simple questions that spanned multiple data sources.
But there was good news, too. All the data existed. If there was just a tool that could collect, deduplicate, normalize, and correlate that data from hundreds of different sources, it could:
 Provide a comprehensive, always up-to-date asset inventory
 Uncover solution and security control gaps  Automate response actions whenever a user
or device deviates from policies

THE NAME

When deciding on what category this kind of solution belonged in, Axonius looked at what was already established.
We quickly realized what we were building was fundamentally different and new. Piggybacking on a clearly defined and existing category simply wasn't an option.
Since we had to create a new category, we wanted a term that:
 Was descriptive enough to give security and IT professionals a ballpark idea of what problems it solved
 Modified something already well-understood, eliciting a "tell me more" response
 Highlighted we were approaching an old problem from a new angle
We called our new category cybersecurity asset management. And we called our product a cybersecurity asset management platform.

6

FROM ASSET MANAGEMENT TO ASSET INTELLIGENCE: CROSSING THE CAASM

NOW IT'S TIME FOR A NEW TERM

There are some unmistakable issues with the term cybersecurity asset management.
1. Definition: What is an asset? Is it just devices? Devices and users? Is a printer an asset? A cloud instance? Is it anything with an IP address? Or just a subset of those that can have an IP address, but only those devices that can have an agent installed?
2. Existing definitions in other contexts: What is an asset? It can be a finance term. A spy term. In the military, asset management is the coordination of a fleet of ships at sea.
3. Baggage: When some IT and security professionals hear the term "asset management", they have an overwhelmingly negative reaction. They think of CMDBs loaded with outdated, conflicting, and duplicative information that's unusable.
4. The "I don't deal with that" problem: Finally, whenever we talk about solving asset management challenges, we're met with, "I don't handle that." If we're talking to security teams, they point to the IT organization. The IT organization points to the desktop support team. The desktop support team points to someone else.

7

FROM ASSET MANAGEMENT TO ASSET INTELLIGENCE: CROSSING THE CAASM

NOW IT'S TIME FOR A NEW TERM

In most cases, "asset management" is problematic because ownership is based on responsibility, rather than a unified mandate to be comprehensive.
"Cybersecurity asset management" is useful because it describes a problem that most (if not all) organizations encounter. It also highlights the even more complicated challenges of ownership, responsibility, baggage from tools and promises past, and the need for a new approach that distances a new class of products from what didn't work before.

CYBER ASSET ATTACK SURFACE MANAGEMENT (CAASM): A NEW TERM IS BORN

FROM ASSET MANAGEMENT TO ASSET INTELLIGENCE: CROSSING THE CAASM

On July 14, 2021, the world welcomed a newborn.
Named cyber asset attack surface management (CAASM for short), Gartner announced its arrival in the Hype Cycle for Network Security 2021.

GARTNER HYPE CYCLE

Gartner's Hype Cycle is a graphical depiction of a common pattern that arises with each new technology or other innovation. Each year, Gartner creates more than 90 Hype Cycles in various domains as a way for clients to track technology maturity and future potential. The five phases in the Hype Cycle are Technology Trigger, Peak of Inflated Expectations, Trough of Disillusionment, Slope of Enlightenment, and Plateau of Productivity.

10

FROM ASSET MANAGEMENT TO ASSET INTELLIGENCE: CROSSING THE CAASM

WHAT IS CAASM?
ACCORDING TO GARTNER, CAASM IS:
"An emerging technology focused on enabling security teams to solve persistent asset visibility and vulnerability challenges. It enables organizations to see all assets (both internal and external) through API integrations with existing tools, query against the consolidated data, identify the scope of vulnerabilities and gaps in security controls, and remediate issues."

Much like our definition of cybersecurity asset management:
The process of gathering asset data (with a primary focus on devices, cloud instances, and users) to strengthen core security functions, including:
 Detection and response: Ensuring detection and response capabilities provide coverage across the enterprise
 Vulnerability management: Understanding which assets may be vulnerable to exploits, and ensuring all assets are being evaluated for vulnerabilities
 Cloud security: Ensuring that cloud instances are secure and configured to prevent overly permissive access rights, even when they're commissioned and decommissioned rapidly
 Incident response: Using enriched, correlated data on assets to expedite incident response investigations and remediation
 Continuous control monitoring: Identifying when security controls are missing and need to be applied

11

FROM ASSET MANAGEMENT TO ASSET INTELLIGENCE: CROSSING THE CAASM

WHAT IS CAASM?

Whether you prefer "CAASM" or "cybersecurity asset management", in both cases we're talking about solving ongoing asset visibility, vulnerability, configuration, and security controls management challenges by:
1. Connecting to existing tools and data sources through API integrations (we call these adapters)
2. Normalizing, deduplicating, deconflicting, and correlating data to show a comprehensive and unique inventory of all assets -- both internal and external, cloud and on-premise
3. Providing queries to understand any and all assets that deviate from policy expectations, security and management tool coverage, configuration details, and vulnerabilities
4. Letting organizations decide what automated response actions to trigger based on conditions
5. Giving customers out-of-the-box charts and dashboards to establish baseline metrics and understand progress toward goals over time

12

FROM ASSET MANAGEMENT TO ASSET INTELLIGENCE: CROSSING THE CAASM

WHAT IS CAASM?

Although our definition is more granular and actionable than the broad CAASM definition, it's an applied, product functionality definition -- rather than one that seeks to describe all potential solutions in a category.
As Axonius created and defined the cybersecurity asset management category, we've built additional features to move from basic attack surface management to automated, action-oriented capabilities.

WHAT'S DRIVING CAASM ADOPTION?

FROM ASSET MANAGEMENT TO ASSET INTELLIGENCE: CROSSING THE CAASM

With each year comes an ever-increasing number of acronyms and repackaged tools aimed at IT and security professionals -- so any new buzzword is met with understandable scrutiny.
Aside from yet another term to remember, why does CAASM actually matter?

13

14

FROM ASSET MANAGEMENT TO ASSET INTELLIGENCE: CROSSING THE CAASM

WHAT'S IN A NAME? CYBERSECURITY ASSET MANAGEMENT

WHAT'S DRIVING CAASM ADOPTION?

Many legacy approaches to asset management and visibility focus on a subset of assets, resulting in fragmentation of data and tool management.
 Endpoint-specific tools: OS-specific agents that tell you what's on a Windows device, Mac, or Linux box
 Network scanners: Produce information about devices by scanning the network -- but only devices they know to look for
 Traffic sniffers: Observe network traffic to find and categorize unmanaged devices, like IoT and OT devices
All of these tools offer visibility into a subset of assets, but do so as a byproduct of what they're designed to do. And since they focus on a specific set of assets, they all come with limitations on what they can't see.
But here's the good news: All the data is there. It's just residing in many separate silos -- silos with APIs.
There are many benefits driving CAASM adoption, but the following are five common reasons cited by Axonius customers.

15

FROM ASSET MANAGEMENT TO ASSET INTELLIGENCE: CROSSING THE CAASM

CAASM DRIVER 1

COMPREHENSIVE VISIBILITY
By connecting to hundreds of security and management solutions that know about assets, organizations are able to finally get a single system of record for all infrastructure. Solutions like Axonius collect data from all relevant data sources at customer-defined fetch intervals to ensure that asset data is both comprehensive and timely.
Before CAASM or cybersecurity asset management solutions, IT and security teams were faced with three options to produce an accurate, up-to-date, and comprehensive inventory of assets:
 Excel: We still hear from IT and security professionals trying to export data in CSVs from multiple sources into a monster of a spreadsheet with pivot tables.
 Write homegrown scripts: Creating, updating, and maintaining scripts to pull data from tools, and trying to deconflict and normalize the output
 CMDB: Relying on a CMDB to provide up-to-date information

CAASM DRIVER 2
WHICH OF MY DEVICES ARE RUNNING WINDOWS 10?
WHICH OF MY DEVICES ARE BEING SCANNED?
WHICH OF MY DEVICES HAVE VERSION X.XX.XX RUNNING?

ABILITY TO QUERY ACROSS ALL DATA SOURCES
CAASM solutions give organizations the ability to ask questions that span all data sources. This includes basic inventory questions like, "How many Windows devices do I have?" to more in-depth and complex queries like, "Which of my Windows 10 devices running a vulnerable version of Chrome have an EDR agent installed, but isn't functioning?"

(8.01%)

TOTAL 8918

CAASM DRIVER 3

FEWER MANUAL AUDITS AND COMPLIANCE REPORTING
With a comprehensive inventory of all assets, combined with queries to understand how assets either adhere to or deviate from policy expectations, organizations can save queries to automatically satisfy audits and map to regulations.

FROM ASSET MANAGEMENT TO ASSET INTELLIGENCE: CROSSING THE CAASM

CAASM DRIVER 4

COLLABORATION USING THE SAME SOURCE OF TRUTH
With IT and security teams often using different tools in their day-to-day operations, they're looking at the asset environment through the lens of different data. By integrating data from multiple sources into a single consolidated view, teams can operate from the same set of normalized data.

17

18

FROM ASSET MANAGEMENT TO ASSET INTELLIGENCE: CROSSING THE CAASM

CAASM DRIVER 5

ABILITY TO CHANGE TOOLS WITHOUT BREAKING EVERYTHING
One of the only certainties in IT and security is that tools will change. Organizations will add a new class of product to secure and manage devices they can't anticipate today. They'll continue to replace products when competitors are more compelling.
Having a CAASM solution that allows for adding, removing, and replacing any number of solutions while still supporting each data source allows for the same visibility, query functionality, and response actions -- regardless of the solutions customers have in place.

IMPACT ON CYBERSECURITY INITIATIVES

FROM ASSET MANAGEMENT TO ASSET INTELLIGENCE: CROSSING THE CAASM

As the name suggests, cyber asset attack surface management supports and strengthens many cybersecurity initiatives. From the simple fact that, "you can't protect what you can't see" to granular vulnerability prioritization, the following are just a few common use cases supported by CAASM solutions like Axonius.

19

20

FROM ASSET MANAGEMENT TO ASSET INTELLIGENCE: CROSSING THE CAASM

SAMPLE USE CASE

INCIDENT RESPONSE
When investigating an incident, security operations teams want all relevant information immediately available to start an investigation. By having timely, comprehensive information without searching through disparate data sources, a security operations center (SOC) is able to accelerate incident response (IR) investigations.
Security analysts reference fully correlated asset inventories in Axonius to accelerate IR investigations. By connecting adapter sources that provide rich information on devices, users, and cloud assets, security analysts can easily correlate alerts with data in Axonius to answer critical incident response questions like:
 Which devices and users were associated with the alerts?
 Where are the devices located?  What software is running on the device?  Which users are associated with the device?
Plus, Axonius provides a RESTful API. Customers can push data to SIEM and SOAR platforms they already use, and focus investigations in one platform.

SAMPLE USE CASE

VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT
Many vulnerability management challenges can be overcome with trustworthy asset data. Two of the more common vulnerability-related use cases for CAASM are finding devices or cloud instances not being scanned, and prioritizing by CVE.
Today's vulnerability assessment tools do an incredible job of identifying known vulnerabilities present in the devices they're aware of. But how can we ensure that all devices -- including workstations, laptops, VMs, and other IT assets -- are being scanned?

23

EXAMPLE AXONIUS QUERY

Example Axonius query: Shows Windows hosts not being scanned by a VA Scanner.
With a full inventory of all assets, along with what is known to vulnerability assessment tools, Axonius shows all assets not being scanned for vulnerabilities. It also automatically adds unscanned assets to the next scheduled scan.

Additionally, many organizations want the ability to execute ad-hoc searches for new vulnerabilities either by CVE ID or by severity.

IMPACT ON IT AND INFRASTRUCTURE INITIATIVES

FROM ASSET MANAGEMENT TO ASSET INTELLIGENCE: CROSSING THE CAASM

Along with the cybersecurity use cases, IT and infrastructure teams benefit from a system of record for infrastructure.
Let's look at a few common examples.

25

26

FROM ASSET MANAGEMENT TO ASSET INTELLIGENCE: CROSSING THE CAASM

SAMPLE USE CASE

ENDPOINT MANAGEMENT
Most endpoints in a typical organization have multiple agents running. But a few of the most common issues around endpoint management are:
 How can I find devices missing an endpoint agent?
 How do I identify devices where the agent is installed but isn't working?
 How do I ensure that the most up-to-date version of those agents is installed?
To understand which devices have a specific endpoint agent installed, simply accessing the admin console of the agent will produce a list of covered devices. But the problem is the inverse: Knowing which devices should have the agent, but don't.

27

FROM ASSET MANAGEMENT TO ASSET INTELLIGENCE: CROSSING THE CAASM

SAMPLE USE CASE

ENDPOINT MANAGEMENT
Part of the challenge is due to device discovery: How does an EPP/EDR solution identify a new device that exists and should be protected? The other issue is based on the context of the security policy. For example, if my security policy requires one endpoint agent for PCs and another for Macs, what mechanism is in place to find the device, understand its context, and ensure the right agent is installed to meet the policy?
Finding devices with agents not functioning correctly adds another level of complexity. Logging into the admin console of any agent-based solution will give you a list of devices on which the agent is installed. You'll also be able to find a "last seen" date, letting you know when the agent has sent data back to the mothership.
You won't, however, be able to see whether the agent has been turned off, was uninstalled by the user, or is simply not functioning correctly.

FROM ASSET MANAGEMENT TO ASSET INTELLIGENCE: CROSSING THE CAASM

SAMPLE USE CASE

CMDB RECONCILIATION AND MAINTENANCE
For many companies, CMDBs are used as a single source of truth for tracking and managing IT assets. However, CMDBs rarely provide a complete picture of all assets at any given time -- especially with the rise of VMs and cloud workloads, where devices are created and deprecated in short time periods.
Moreover, CMDBs are often problematic because of data conflict. Data inputs into CMDBs often have a wide variety in naming conventions, and even fields like OS type, OS version, full OS string, host name, and others vary frequently.

SAMPLE USE CASE

CMDB RECONCILIATION AND MAINTENANCE
Axonius aggregates and deconflicts asset data to provide a singular, credible view into any asset. Customers use Axonius to generate a comprehensive asset inventory with all unique devices, users, and cloud instances.
Common CMDB reconciliation and maintenance questions are:
 How many assets are missing from the CMDB?  Are there devices that have been marked
missing or disposed of in the CMDB, but that are still active?  Do device details in my CMDB match the latest data available?
