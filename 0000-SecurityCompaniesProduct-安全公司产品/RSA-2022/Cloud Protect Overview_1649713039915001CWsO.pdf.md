HOW WE SECURE CLOUD

PROTEGRITY CLOUD PROTECT
Cloud Protect simplifies the management and enforcement of data protection across cloudnative and hybrid deployments, protecting data in every corner of the cloud.
Why Cloud Matters
Protegrity wants businesses to embrace cloud--even leap into it--with a confidence that's grounded in the knowledge that their data remains protected no matter where it moves, is applied, or rests in cloud systems.

Protegrity Cloud Protect, a solution within the Protegrity Data Protection Platform, protects data no matter what it does in cloud environments. Because the platform is designed to follow our firm belief that we must be cloudneutral, Cloud Protect also honors that commitment. Companies are free to operate across clouds, and we're there to provide cross-cloud data compatibility and security.

Cloud Challenges are Real
The cloud makes so many things easier that it's tempting to overlook its challenges, particularly in data security. With data everywhere in all sorts of cloud systems, the data-security practices can't stay rooted in the philosophies required of on-premises systems.

Making good on our commitment to data ubiquity, the solution coalesces the many disparate security policies of all those cloud technologies into a centralized tool that simplifies an enterprise's decisions about data protection. Data is all over the cloud, and it should be protected everywhere in the cloud. Protegrity Cloud Protect safeguards all types of enterprise data in the cloud, including the most sensitive data that needs special attention.

CHALLENGES INHERENT TO THE CLOUD INCLUDE. . .
Data Security is Murky Cloud providers offer businesses a bounty of technological benefits, but they sometimes come up short on data protection. Cloud-native data protection often doesn't meet an organization's demanding expectations. Enterprises can't take chances with less than ideal data security.
Different Cloud Policies Slow Innovation Organizations often can't innovate because they're busy tending to disparate data-security policy enforcement across their many on-premises and cloud-native databases and tools. With data-security administration decentralized, compliance and security teams scramble to align expectations for data privacy with the data-security policies of different vendors.
Separate Responsibilities, Singular Problem Businesses recognize the imperative to separate the duties of those responsible for the setting of data-security policies and granting access to users. By splitting responsibilities, an enterprise ensures that no one person or department has the keys to security.

Tap into the Power of Data
The cloud is a perimeter-free space where innovation is within reach, but it's also where data needs complete protection as it moves across operational and analytical systems, including databases such as Snowflake and Redshift, data warehouses, big data and data science platforms, file servers, and mainframes.
Protegrity Cloud Protect centralizes and simplifies the enforcement and management of data-security policies across disparate cloud systems and tools, protecting sensitive data across the large sweep of cloudbased applications and functions that modernize business. Its wide range of protection methods and options ensure that no data is left unprotected, and that it is protected before it leaves the enterprise.
Cloud Protect ensures freedom by supporting a wide variety of data storage platforms that help enterprises store their growing data stockpiles, SaaS applications that make businesses run, analytics platforms that foster business intelligence, and the homegrown applications that employees sometimes prefer.
Making good on our commitment to data ubiquity, the solution coalesces the many disparate security policies of all those cloud technologies into a centralized tool that simplifies an enterprise's decisions about data protection.

Cloud Protect Strategies
1) Cloud Data Discovery: The Discovery of sensitive data shouldn't feel like a game of Whac-a-Mole Companies need to discover sensitive data in their many cloud applications and platforms so that it can be protected, and innovation can proceed uninterrupted. Data offers value only if it's discovered, classified, and protected, otherwise it "sits around" untapped. Without a cohesive strategy, businesses find themselves constantly reacting, rather than proactively driving the very initiatives intended to fuel innovation.
2) Cloud Migration Starter: Protecting data during cloud migration sets the tone for secure cloud use Effective security protects data in its journey to the cloud. Businesses are rapidly moving data to the cloud for many reasons, chief among them the desire to reduce physical IT overhead and the promise of driving innovation through cloud technologies. Cloud migration is, in itself, never simple, but complicating matters is the accounting of sensitive data and determining how it should be protected. A head start in migration prevents data security headaches down the road.
3) Cloud Innovation Protector: Innovation will amount to little if data can't be effectively protected in the cloud The rubber meets the road when businesses go beyond sampling cloud services and start shifting workloads to cloud-enabled platforms and moving data to AI-supported applications and other tools. Innovation begins when enterprises implement, in earnest, a number of cloud-first, cloud-native initiatives across the enterprise--aiming for new insights, efficiencies, improvements, collaborations, and value. And it's at this stage where sensitive data must be fully protected if enterprises want to innovate without disruption.

Why Protegrity Cloud Protect?

Cloud Protect is the industry standard because. . .  It protects data in all kinds of cloud environments  It protects all types of data in the cloud  It fosters innovation in the cloud  It streamlines data protection strategies  It empowers businesses to freely access and analyze data
With cloud computing, enterprises improve collaboration with partners and customers, and their employees are able to work together from anywhere. With the cloud, they can pursue AI, containerization, DevSecOps, and other technologies that enhance how they create and sell products and services. With the cloud, they can incorporate data analytics into an iterative, enterprise-wide function that lets all employees quickly extract value, apply insights in real time, and predict outcomes that accelerate growth.

Cloud Protect bridges the gap between cloud innovation and cloud security by securing data in the compute layer that's available to lines of business but is inaccessible to cloud platforms. The solution extends internal data-security policies to cloud-native databases such as Snowflake and other cloud-based platforms to keep sensitive data private.
As organizations shift more workloads to the cloud and move even more data to cloud applications and warehouses, Cloud Protect is there to secure the foundation of a 21st Century digital infrastructure.
