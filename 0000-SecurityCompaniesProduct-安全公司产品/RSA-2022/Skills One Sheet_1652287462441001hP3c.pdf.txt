"Traditionally, during turbulent times, the budget for IT training gets cut. However, the ability to upskill and reskill tech teams is more important than it has ever been. The way we work is changing rapidly and we have to be ready. My advice is to make skilling as easy as possible. Empowering your employees to learn is the most important thing you can do for your organization's future success."
