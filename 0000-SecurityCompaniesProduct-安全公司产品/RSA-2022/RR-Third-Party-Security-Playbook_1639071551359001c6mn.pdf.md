OVERVIEW
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Third-Party Security Risk Management Playbook (Playbook) is the definitive study of third-party security risk management practices. Based on in-depth interviews of risk executives from 30 domestic and global firms, it reveals the real-world capabilities and practices employed to manage third-party cyber risk, distilled into 14 capabilities with 72 common, emerging, and pioneering practices.
Compare your own program with the Playbook data about what other organizations are doing. Use it to identify your own goals and objectives and refer to the Playbook to determine which capabilities and practices make sense for you.
The Playbook data show that there is a common set of widely adopted third-party risk management practices,

founded on strong program management practices and and periodic risk assessments rooted in questionnairebased information collection and analysis. However, innovative organizations are aggressively breaking out of the traditional periodic attestation-centric model, developing capabilities to gain continuous insight into third-party risk and act on that information. They are seeing promising results from their early efforts in these areas, reporting better risk outcomes and better scale.
The Playbook focuses on capabilities and practices unique and interesting to third-party risk management. Common business management practices such as budgeting and staffing, while prerequisite to the success of third-party risk management, are intentionally excluded.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Thank you to the executives from 30 enterprises leading third-party risk management initiatives who shared their program practices and expert insight to provide this Playbook. They each joined in third-party risk round table discussions, participated in formal interviews, and reviewed drafts to bring this study to publication.

WHY THIRD-PARTY RISK MATTERS

BIG IMPACT
Enterprises entrust the protection of their crown jewels--their customer data, their reputation, their finances, and their business availability--with third parties. A breach of your third party is a breach of your enterprise, so you need to know: Are they trustworthy? Why? Why not? What should be done about it? These questions are yours to answer and act on.
BIG CHALLENGES
Third-party risk management is hard. It requires deep transparency, strong accountability, and effective collaboration. Third-party risk has to achieve this position with hundreds and even thousands of organizations while being an outsider to every organization. Additionally, third-party risk has to solve this with limited personnel and resources.
This need--to achieve really good risk outcomes from the outside with limited resources--will result in dramatic risk management innovation, key of which will be development of machine learning and artificial intelligence-based risk assessment capabilities. These inventions will occur within the context of third-party risk management and be adopted by enterprises for internal risk management. Necessity is the mother of invention, and the necessity is pressing in a big way.
THE GREATER GOOD
Third-party risk management is a process of holding enterprises accountable to good risk management practices. As you improve the risk management capabilities of your third parties you improve the security of the Internet. The improvement decreases the likelihood of data being breached, decreases the likelihood of systems being turned into DDOS drones or malware servers, and increases the likelihood that systems are going to reliably fulfill their intended purposes. The work of third-party risk management is work for the greater good.

PLAYBOOK STRUCTURE

SUMMARY OF OBSERVATIONS
PARTICIPANT DEMOGRAPHICS

What percentage of vendors require on-going cyber risk management?

The healthcare industry has the highest percentage of their total vendor population that require ongoing cyber security risk management at 19%, followed by finance / insurance at 13%.
You might want to double check your risk calculations if you are in healthcare or finance and are only managing cyber security risk of 3% of your vendors.

Where does your third-party security risk team report into?
97% of third-party security risk teams report into Information Security. Organizational expertise and mission focus were the primary reasons reported for having the function report into information security.

How many risk rating tiers do you use?
It is pretty common to see firms use four or five risk rating tiers. The reason? Many companies have created a `critical' tier as a home for those vendors that are absolutely essential to the success of the organization.

SUMMARY OF OBSERVATIONS
PROGRAM OPERATIONS INSIGHTS

How many security risk analysts does it take to manage a vendor?

Well, it depends on the industry. The financial sector allocates more analyts per vendor than any other sector, with one analyst handling the recurring assessment load of 73 vendors. You get into the other sectors and it can be as high as one analyst managing 133 vendors.
Is there an inverse relationship between regulatory oversight load and analyst management load? Perhaps, though more data is required to answer this question.

RISK RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

WHAT Allocate risk assessment resources commensurate with the residual third-party risk exposure, informed by inherent risk, results from previous assessments, and data from continuous surface risk assessments.
WHY Allocating resources based on residual exposure improves outcomes by focusing analyst attention on improving performance of poor performing third parties. It yields better scale because analysts are not wasting time over-assessing third parties that are strong performers.
HOW Allocate resources based on residual risk rather than inherent risk. Calculate residual risk by factoring

inherent risk with results from previous assessment engagements and continuous surface assessment results. Increase assessment frequency and depth for poorly performing third parties. Decrease assessment frequency and scope for strong performers. For example, you might set a schedule as shown below:

THIRD-PARTY ASSESSMENT ENGAGEMENT

WHAT Periodically execute a privileged-access assessment of each third party. Tune the assessment plan based on third-party inherent risk and known strengths and weaknesses.
WHY Privileged-access assessments provide a comprehensive understanding of the security risk management program from which you can best measure risk exposure and prescribe recommendations for tactical and systemic performance improvement.
HOW Prepare for the assessment by reviewing prior assessments and continuous surface assessment data. Familiarize yourself with the organization's IT profile,

including hosting providers, hosting geo-locations, and technology stack. Modify the assessment plan to go deep into areas of control weakness and back off on areas of strength.
Use the third party representations to understand how they have invested in risk-management people, processes, and technology. Use the objective continuous surface assessment data to inform you of how well they have implemented and are operating their risk management program. Also, use the surface assessment data to validate third-party claims, calling out technical gaps and identifying root cause issues.

RISK TREATMENT

WHAT Engage with third parties to address tactical and systemic security performance gaps necessary to achieve a satisfactory risk-management position.
WHY Reduce your risk exposure by holding your third parties accountable to meeting your risk management performance standards. Customer risk feedback to vendors that is timely, relevant, and actionable is a powerful motivator for third parties to do the right thing.

HOW Provide your third parties with risk-prioritized action plans that guide them in addressing tactical and systemic risk. Set expectations for issue remediation timing and follow up on all commitments. Proper risk prioritization is essential to ensure that resources are deployed first to issues that matter most and only to issues that actually expose you to risk.
For more proactive engagement with your third parties, provide them access to continuous surface risk assessment results. With access to continuous surface assessment results, third parties can proactively address issues that you would otherwise have to communicate.

PRACTICE Share the assessment results with the third party. Share the assessment results with internal stakeholders. Record assessment results in a risk register. Hold third parties accountable to addressing the identified issues. Provide third parties ongoing access to continuous surface assessment results for their own organization.

WHY Mapping service providers to your third parties enables you to understand your service provider concentration risk. If Dynamic Network Services or AWS Ireland goes down, which of my third parties are impacted?
Identifying significant fourth parties also enables you to develop control assessment standards for assessing third-party use of significant providers.

HOW Faciliate this capability by implementing the continuous surface risk assessment capability.
Identify the hosting providers of third-party systems using network registration information associated with each third-party system IP address. Monitor significant fourth parties for security breaches and service outages that may impact your third parties.
Develop and enforce control assessment standards for assessing third party use of significant fourth parties. Faciliate conducting expansive assessment of significant fourth parties in cases where the fourth party is also your third party.

Monitor significant fourth parties for material security breaches or operational outages.
Develop and enforce control assessment standards for assessing third party use of significant fourth parties.
Conduct expansive assessments of material fourth parties in cases where the fourth party is also your third party.

CAPABILITY
GEOLOCATION AWARENESS

WHAT Know third-party system geolocations. Monitor for illegal or risky geographies, which may shift over time due to regulations, geo-political tensions or natural disasters.
WHY Knowledge of system geolocation is essential to ensuring that you are not doing business in countries sanctioned by OFAC, or under EU Embargo or UN Embargo.

HOW Faciliate this capability by implementing the continuous surface risk assessment capability.
Identify the geolocation of third-party systems through system IP address geolocation mapping data. Monitor system locations for regulatory compliance. Provide third-party system geolocation data to the business continuity and disaster recovery teams to aid them in managing exposure to geopolitical risks and natural disasters.

Third-party system geolocation awareness is also helpful for arming the disaster recovery and business continuity teams with intelligence to better handle geo-political risk exposure and natural disasters.

PRACTICE Know the geolocation of third-party systems. Monitor significant geographies for events that may impact your operations. Maintain a list of geographies where system hosting is not allowed.

"We leverage our visibility into the geolocation of third-party systems to help our disaster recovery team better manage through natural disasters. For example, when the hurricanes were bearing down on Houston, our DR team used our data to understand which partners were potentially exposed.
