WhiteSource SAST Security at the Speed of DevOps
The Challenge
As application vulnerabilities have become the riskiest aspect of the enterprise attack surface1, enterprise security managers increasingly look to Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools to identify security vulnerabilities in the custom code written by application developers. Unfortunately, traditional SAST tools are a poor fit for today's fast-paced development environments. Traditional SAST tools are famous for being --  Cumbersome. They often require developers to leave their development environment to trigger the scan,
view results, and research how to fix security problems.  Slow to produce results. They typically take hours to run, sometimes days. This is a poor fit for DevOps
teams whose release cycles -- from code commit to application deployment -- are getting faster and faster.
WhiteSource's Unique Solution
WhiteSource SAST is a breakthrough product that lets enterprise application developers create new applications quickly, without sacrificing security.  It's ergonomic. It integrates with your existing DevOps environment and CI/CD pipeline, so developers
don't need to separately configure or trigger the scan.  It's comprehensive. Supports 27 different programming languages and various different programming
frameworks.  It's fast. 10x or more faster than traditional SAST solutions.

Future Enhancements
While WhiteSource SAST is already demonstrably better than most other SAST products, WhiteSource engineers are developing an exciting set of enhancements. Our goal is to leverage the same "remediation first" approach that has made our software composition analysis (SCA) product the market leader for four years in a row. Enhancements will include:  Automated remediation for custom code weaknesses, as pioneered by WhiteSource Cure, a product that we
released in July 2021. WhiteSource Cure will be integrated within WhiteSource SAST for seamless operation.  Repository integrations where vulnerability alerts and remediation pull requests will be listed directly in the
developer's normal workflow, for the most efficient shift-left experience.  Unified deployment, management and reporting platform, combining our SCA product with our SAST product.
