WHAT EMPLOYEES AND CUSTOMERS NEED NOW
Digital transformation has been underway for decades, but in a fast-changing world, digital resiliency and application delivery are now a matter of survival. Following a rapid expansion of online life, a full 64% of U.S. employees are now working from home. Consumer activity has seen a major shift online as well, from banking, retail and media to entertainment and healthcare.
As the lines between office and home blur, so have the user expectations for each part of daily life. Whether people are working, taking care of personal needs, or relaxing, they need a high-quality application delivery experience for the applications they use, and security they can count on. And the impact of downtime can be devastating.
Meanwhile, your organization faces a long list of priorities including business continuity, data protection, compliance, business agility, and efficiency, wherever and however you do business. It's no wonder that 70% of businesses planned to increase or maintain digital transformation spending during the pandemic.
In this eBook, we will talk about five key digital resiliency challenges for application delivery that organizations are facing today and how they can be addressed, including:
 Delivering a great application delivery experience every time  Ensuring no excuses application availability  Protecting customer data and privacy  Operating more simply and efficiently
 Innovating at digital speed
"The heavy industry sector never stops. Providing high availability uptime for our applications is critical. The cost of downtime can rack up quickly, and Turner Industries does everything possible to avoid it."
-- Chris Milton, Technology Manager

40% OF ENTERPRISES
enterprises report that a single hour of downtime can cost their business from $1 million to over $5 million.
46% OF USERS
don't revisit poorly performing websites and a one-second delay reduces customer satisfaction by 16%.

DELIVER A GREAT EXPERIENCE EVERY TIME
Without taking a unified approach to manage performance, troubleshoot problems, and optimize traffic across your complex environment, you cannot meet user expectations for a high-quality experience. Both customer experience and employee experience are critical to business performance--and in the modern era, both relate directly to digital experience. In fact, 40% of enterprises report that a single hour of downtime can cost their business from $1 million to over $5 million.
Manage Performance with Visibility and Analytics
Today's more complex infrastructures make it harder to keep applications running at their best. To simplify management, choose an application infrastructure that is consistent across every environment you use, with holistic visibility into devices, applications, policies, users, and more across data centers and clouds. A layer of analytics can help you reduce downtime, meet SLAs, and make changes quickly to keep pace with user expectations.
Act Fast on Early Warnings to Solve Problems Proactively
By the time users report a problem, the damage to your business has already begun. 46% of users don't revisit poorly performing websites and a one-second delay reduces customer satisfaction by 16%. Your application delivery solution should provide early alerts to emerging issues while avoiding false positives and reducing signal noise. By gathering and analyzing data from across your hybrid environment, you can work proactively to detect anomalies sooner, diagnose problems more accurately, and resolve issues more quickly.
Keep your Clouds Redundant too
With applications, users, and data centers distributed around the world, it is all too easy for server bottlenecks to get in the way of performance. Use global server load balancing to intelligently guide application traffic to the best available site for each user so they get the best possible service.

ENSURE NO-EXCUSES APPLICATION AVAILABILITY
Both within the workforce and with customers, business continuity depends on keeping applications available to every user, every time. More than two-thirds of companies compete on the basis of customer experience, and 92 percent of customers would abandon a company after two or three negative interactions. That means meeting exceptionally high standards--like 47% of people expecting web pages to load in under two seconds.
Without high availability, disaster recovery, and rapid failover across cloud providers, employees are less productive, and customers less satisfied--and your business can go off track.
Manage Traffic to Avoid Potholes
If your servers are slow and you are unable to re-route traffic quickly, your users will be affected. What is the health and response time of each site in your environment, and can you make intelligent adjustments on-the-fly for uninterrupted application availability? When a site or server slows--or fails--you need to be able to re-route its application traffic quickly before users are affected. Use global web traffic management to assess the health and response time of each site in your environment and make intelligent adjustments on-the-fly for uninterrupted application availability.
Be Prepared for Disaster Recovery and Capacity Surges
Do you have a redundancy plan that can help you recover quickly from a data center failure and provide extra burst capacity in case of a surge? By using a public cloud environment as a backup for your on-premises data center, you can provide high availability even more cost-effectively.
Keep your Clouds Redundant too
Redundancy isn't just for on-premises infrastructure. To protect yourself against a failure or service problem in your public cloud environments, do you have a secondary environment ready to go in a different provider's cloud, with the ability to fail over seamlessly when needed?

MORE THAN
50% OF ORGANIZATIONS
were hit by ransomware in 2020, while the average payment increased to 60%.
$8.19 MILLION DOLLARS
is the cost of the average data breach has now reached.
15.4 MILLION DDoS ATTACKS
is the total number projected attacks by 2023. This is nearly doubled from 7.9 million in 2018.

PROTECT CUSTOMER DATA AND PRIVACY
You can't take shortcuts with security. A single gap or weak spot can bring devastating consequences, from disrupted operations, damaged business relationships, and lost customer loyalty to steep regulatory fines. Threats of all types are increasing rapidly; more than half of organizations were hit by ransomware in 2020, while the average payment increased 60% from the first quarter to the second quarter of that year. The cost of the average data breach has now reached $8.19 million. The total number of DDoS attacks has been projected to nearly double from 7.9 million in 2018 to 15.4 million by 2023. And with malware attacks, cybercrime tactics and enterprise technology innovating at a breakneck pace, the level of risk will only continue to rise.
Make sure you can maintain effective threat protection, data protection, customer privacy, and compliance across every on-premises and cloud environment you use.
Unify Security Policies Across Clouds and Data Centers
Managing security policies separately across different clouds and data centers makes it all too easy for gaps and compliance lapses to sneak in. Instead, leverage a unified policy infrastructure across every platform you use, so services and applications have the same, consistent protection wherever they are deployed.
Carefully Manage User Application Access Across Platforms
As people connect in more ways, from more locations to more types of applications, access management needs to be a top priority. Take a Zero Trust approach by making sure you can manage authentication consistently in every user scenario while providing employees with the right level of access for their needs, especially when moving applications from tightly controlled local on-premises data centers to public clouds.
Build Threat Protection into your Infrastructure
With cyberthreats growing in volume and sophistication every day, you never know when an attack might strike--if it hasn't already. Weave protective measures throughout your multi-platform environment, including security analytics, DDoS protection, web application firewalls (WAFs), authentication, modern TLS/SSL encryption standards, and threat intelligence so you're prepared for anything.

OPERATE MORE SIMPLY AND EFFICIENTLY
The more efficiently you can work, the more value you can get from your budget and resources and to deliver more value for your customers and employees. In a recent study by OnePoll, a survey of more than 1,000 office workers, many of whom were working from home, showed that 77% were frustrated with outdated tech at work.
Work Smarter to Work Cheaper
Use analytics to determine the most cost-efficient ways to use your available resources both on-premises and in the cloud. By providing actionable intelligence to your staff, you can help even less experienced team members work more quickly and effectively.
Automate, Automate, Automate... and Simplify
Manual effort can be costly, error-prone, and inconsistent. In October 2020, nearly 16,000 COVID-19 cases went unreported due to an Excel error of the Public Health England (PHE). Find opportunities for automation wherever you can, across every type of environment, for more effective management at a lower cost. At the same time, look to simplify operations, especially as the cloud and software shifts accelerate. Look for portable, customizable capacity, and self-service licensing options to provide agility to your application services.
Put it all Behind a Single Pane of Glass, and Control
A more complex network environment calls for an efficient view into network activity. Give admins a single pane of glass for visibility and policy control across every part of your infrastructure, regardless of cloud provider or form factor, so they can manage it more easily and consistently to avoid mistakes.

Support DevOps and SecOps Efficacy
Digital success depends on being fast without sacrificing quality. Automation can help you streamline DevOps and SecOps tasks while preventing costly errors so you can bring better applications to market, faster. But can you see the results, good or bad? Enable them to be successful with visibility into results of code pushes instantly, enabling continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) visualization in real-time.

"At Delta Dental, we like to work smarter, not harder. DevOps can radically improve the cycle time for enhancements to application code."
