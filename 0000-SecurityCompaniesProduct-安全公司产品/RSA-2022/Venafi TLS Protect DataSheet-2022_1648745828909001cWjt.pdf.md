· Speed incident response with automated bulk certificate replacement

Machines are driving significant advances in business growth and agility. But before machines can communicate privately and securely, they need machine identities to identify, authenticate and secure machine-to-machine communications. Just as people rely on usernames and passwords to identify and authenticate themselves, machines rely on cryptographic keys and digital certificates to serve as their identities. This includes TLS certificates used for authentication, encryption and decryption.
However, the aggressive enterprise adoption of machines and the expansion of encryption have outpaced the manual, ad hoc tools most organizations rely on to manage their TLS certificates. Due to manual processes or homegrown tools, machine identities go largely untracked, unmanaged and unmonitored. The inability to inventory and enforce policy for certificates can leave organizations vulnerable to certificate-based application outages and security breaches.
Venafi TLS Protect delivers visibility, intelligence and automation to manage TLS certificates and digital keys. Venafi is the only solution that provides complete and continuous visibility and monitoring of machine identities across highly segmented and complex networks, including public and private clouds, combined with automated, intelligence-driven actions that securely scale encryption, remove error-prone manual installation and remediate vulnerabilities and weaknesses.

Challenges
From system outages to network breaches, lack of proper management of TLS results in significant security risks to businesses.
Outages. Without the automation of the entire certificate lifecycle, the risk of certificate-related outages increases. Keys and certificates need to be properly installed and configured, often on multiple systems when clustering or load balancing. Yet, in certificate lifecycles, installation and configuration tend to be the most error-prone tasks. If they are misinstalled or misconfigured, certificate-related outages can bring down the systems that they are meant to support.
Breaches. When the certificates that serve as machine identities are compromised or forged, cybercriminals can use them to appear legitimate, perform Manin-the-Middle (MiTM) attacks and eavesdrop on communications. And the vast majority of network attacks cloak themselves in HTTPS to evade detection and bypass critical security controls.
No Crypto-Agility. Most organizations lack cryptoagility, the ability to quickly replace certificates in response to security events, such certificate authority (CA) compromises, vulnerabilities or other errors. Without automated installation and validation, cryptoagility is impeded, delaying incident response and increasing the risk of damage.
Compliance Failures. In most organizations, administrators perform key and certificate installation and configuration for the systems that they control.

Outages on Business-Critical Infrastructure
91%
Before Venafi, 91% had at least 1 outage a year that impacted business-critical infrastructure.

With this approach, auditors often find inconsistent security practices, are unable to validate installation and configuration, and discover administrators with direct access to private keys, which increases the possibility of compromise. Lack of Scalability. With the dramatic increase in machines, manual methods of issuing machine identities are slowing down IT services and the rollout of business applications. Plus, each certificate takes an average of four hours per year to maintain. Multiply this by thousands or hundreds of thousands, and overhead can add up quickly. If organizations face outages, breaches or other security incidents, management needs quickly soar.

The Solution: Venafi TLS Protect
By combining visibility, intelligence and automation, TLS Protect delivers comprehensive management and protection of TLS machine identities. The result is improved management and security that stops unplanned outages and breaches, enables fast cryptoagility, validates compliance, supports audits and allows organizations to scale.
Global Visibility. TLS Protect automates enterprisewide discovery of machine identities, providing a complete and accurate inventory. This discovery includes the configuration, location and use of certificates across the extended global enterprise-- including those on premises, in virtual or cloud environments and even IoT.
Policy Enforcement. TLS Protect collects detailed machine identity intelligence that enables organizations to apply management and security policies to avoid outages and identify security blind spots. The intelligence is gathered through continuous monitoring and includes use, location, ownership, pending expirations, key lengths, signing algorithms, protocols, ciphers and other attributes.
Streamlined Enrollment. TLS Protect supports any CA, including out-of-the-box integrations with leading CAs. It also offers an extensive technology partner ecosystem, with integrations ranging from the world's leading providers of security solutions to the hottest DevOps technologies. Leaders everywhere have joined Venafi to create more than 1,000 technology integrations that automatically coordinate access to machine identities.

"Venafi allows DevOps teams to request and manage their own keys and certificates. Plus, an additional layer of security approval makes it easier to bring certificate issuance into governance."

Automated Installation, Configuration and Validation. TLS Protect provides automated certificate installation with integrations across hundreds of applications, devices, services and CAs. This includes out-of-the-box integrations with load balancers, web applications and network traffic inspection devices. TLS Protect can also integrate automated certificate installation with any system that allows APIs using custom scripts.
Every day, Venafi uses each network device's API to confirm that certificates are still correctly installed, ensuring that out-of-band misconfigurations are detected after installation.
Fast Remediation. TLS Protect goes beyond identifying policy violations and enables organizations to apply automated policy enforcement. In addition, organizations can identify keys and certificates that have been impacted by security events, such as CA compromises, vulnerabilities or other errors. With the impacted keys and certificates identified, they can then be automatically replaced, drastically improving cryptoagility and closing the window of exposure.
