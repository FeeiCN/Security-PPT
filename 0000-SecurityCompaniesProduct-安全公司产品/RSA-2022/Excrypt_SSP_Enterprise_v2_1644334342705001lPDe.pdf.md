Hardware Security Module

The World's Most Advanced Financial Hardware Security Module
Protect Sensitive Payment Data at Rest, in Use, and In Motion
Electronic payment networks need data security solutions that scale in speed and can expand over time to support emerging payment types and algorithms. The Excrypt SSP Enterprise v.2 is the world's fastest hardware security module for financial transaction processing, offering robust functionality and full backward compatibility with the Excrypt SSP Series of HSMs. It has a high degree of scalability, offering speeds in excess of 20,000 transactions per second, all in a compact, 1U rackmount chassis.
With integrated disaster recover and redundancy features to ensure rock-solid reliability, the device complies with key management best practices and contains some of the industry's most advanced security features.
The Excrypt SSP Enterprise v.2 excels in high throughput environments where rock-solid stability and functional extensibility is a must. Not only does this device provide increased redundancy, greater performance, and platform virtualization, it's the fastest payment HSM in the world, capable of processing over 20,000 transactions per second.

HSM Virtualization
The Excrypt SSP Enterprise v.2 can create multiple logically independent HSMs inside a single host device for separate transaction processing environments.
 Unique firmware versions, users, key storage space, and security policies on each virtual HSM
 Multiple methods of access including a web portal, API, the Guardian Series 3, and VirtuCrypt
 Test new firmware on an independent virtual instance
 Increase the ROI of your HSM infrastructure
