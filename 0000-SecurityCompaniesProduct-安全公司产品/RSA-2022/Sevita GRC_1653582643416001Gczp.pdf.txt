Onspring Case Study: Expanding Beyond Traditional Governance, Risk & Compliance

Expanding Beyond Traditional Governance, Risk & Compliance
A Healthcare & Human Services Case Study

OVERVIEW
Manual tracking of GRC functions in spreadsheets harbored too many limitations and increased the risk from human error, so Sevita adopted the Onspring GRC platform to create efficiency and more accuracy. What started as a specific GRC initiative ultimately expanded into a robust process improvement program across multiple functions of the business.
"Onspring is more than a standard GRC system, which was exactly what we needed."
