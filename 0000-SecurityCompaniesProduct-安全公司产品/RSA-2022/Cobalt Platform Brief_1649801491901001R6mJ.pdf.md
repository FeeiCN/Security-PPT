Compliance Frameworks We Test For

Companies need manual penetration testing performed on their digital assets to establish trust with customers, comply with regulatory requirements, and improve their security posture.
Traditional pentesting services take weeks to schedule and deliver, work in isolation, and provide written results long after code has been released. This cumbersome and inefficient process does not fit with today's agile development practices, leaving companies exposed to the risk of breach.
Cobalt's Pentest as a Service (PtaaS) platform is modernizing traditional pentesting. By combining a SaaS platform with an exclusive community of testers, we deliver the real-time insights you need to remediate risk quickly and innovate securely.
Start Testing Faster Launch pentests in days, not weeks with our intuitive platform and team of on-demand security experts

Remediate Risk Smarter Accelerate find-to-fix cycles through technology integrations and real-time collaboration with pentesters

Make Security Stronger Mature your security program through a scalable, data-driven approach to pentesting

"The main benefits that we get from Cobalt are speed, scalability, and repeatability. We're able to quickly launch and execute pentests; and beyond that, we're able to see individual findings in real time and relay them to the engineering team so they can start triaging immediately."
Eric Galis - VP of Compliance and Security at Cengage Read The Full Case Study
