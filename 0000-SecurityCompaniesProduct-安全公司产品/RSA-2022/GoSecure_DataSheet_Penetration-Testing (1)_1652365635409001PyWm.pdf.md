GOSECURE PENETRATION TESTING PROGRAMS DIG DEEPER:
 External Network Security: GoSecure focuses external intrusion tests on the types of opportunistic attacks that will harm your organization. This includes mapping/reducing your attack surface, finding and exploiting flaws and exposing password vulnerability.
 Internal Network Security: Insider security threats are on the rise. GoSecure will design intrusion tests to determine what an attacker could compromise once inside your organization's network.
 Wireless Networks: Organizations are dependent on wired networks and Wi-Fi for both employee and non-employee access to both company data and the internet. GoSecure will assess the security of your solutions and help ensure data is transmitted securely across networks, with proper configurations and ensure accesses are granted as intended.
 Endpoints and Device Security Testing: Organizations are focused on security at the user level, which means that testing for endpoints and devices is critical to ensuring that risks and gaps are identified. GoSecure will design an engagement to expose issues with policies, processes and technology down to the endpoint and device level.

 Web Application Testing: Organizations that develop custom web applications want to ensure that access is limited to authorized users and their data is secure. GoSecure will test for weaknesses at the point of authentication and once inside the application, create a deeper and more comprehensive assessment of application data security.
 Mobile Applications: Mobile applications are increasingly the leading point of engagement for organizations with their customers, partners and associates. GoSecure will design a program to test mobile application security based on your needs.
