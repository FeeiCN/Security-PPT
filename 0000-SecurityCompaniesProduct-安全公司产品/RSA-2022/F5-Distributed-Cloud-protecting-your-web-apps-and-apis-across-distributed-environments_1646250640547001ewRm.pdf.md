Extend Application and API Security Across Multi-Cloud and Edge Environments
In today's application-centric world, app security is business continuity.
Securing your apps means protecting your business, customers, and revenue streams. That's why no one hoping to operate or facilitate commerce online can afford to neglect security. Threats to your apps are universal, while application security technology and expertise has traditionally been difficult to acquire, implement, and maintain. This has become even more challenging as development models and application architectures have evolved to include multi-cloud deployments, API proliferation, auto-scaling, and serverless implementations.
Modern microservices are increasingly being built using distributed app architectures to accommodate growing application usage and deliver improved performance. As users' availability and performance expectations change, organizations are choosing to run lightweight applications at branch and satellite locations to speed up data access and processing of critical telemetry on premises or at the edge as opposed to long hauling back to an originating cloud. But it can be challenging for businesses to provide consistent and effective security for these distributed application instances.
NetOps and SecOps have been unable to keep up with the rapid pace of change, and DevOps teams see them--and their security toolkits--as impediments to the innovation the business demands. Plus, the growth in modern microservices-based applications and APIs has only expanded application attack surfaces and traditional solutions are unable to provide consistent coverage. SecOps teams have been forced to leverage and maintain disparate, legacy security solutions and as a result, their efforts net fewer returns than they would otherwise.
The results of all these challenges are higher TCO and a reduction in security efficacy in combatting evolving attacks. Stretched resources and ineffective tooling often mean SecOps responses when attacks occur are conducted manually--placing an even greater burden on their already-constrained resources.
Organizations that neglect security do so at the risk to the business itself. However, there's a way to simplify the complexity and make things difficult for cybercriminals: investment in a security-focused infrastructure that can adapt, scale, and leverage machine learning and global threat intelligence can mean the difference between frustration and efficacy in protecting the web apps and APIs that drive your business.

KEY FEATURES
Full-featured security solutions wherever your apps are Automate security provisioning for applications and workloads wherever they are deployed-- at the network edge, in a public cloud or on-prem--via the centralized control plane, including self-healing and progressive rollout with health monitoring.
Strong protection that scales to meet your needs Robust and adaptive security services such as an advanced web app firewall, DDoS mitigation, bot detection, and API security can be layered according to the needs of your organization--or the needs of individual apps.
Centralized observability: network + apps + security Get unified visibility from application to infrastructure across heterogeneous edge and cloud deployments, including granular status of application deployments, infrastructure health, security, availability, and performance.
Purpose-built global network F5 offers a high-performance global backbone--with 20+ global PoPs spanning 13 metro markets--optimized for app-toapp connectivity and global app delivery.
Identity and secrets management Manage identity lifecycle for each application instance via automatic certificate rotation, delivering uniform identity services for applications across different multicloud and/or edge environments.

Secure Centrally, Operate Globally--with Ease
F5 protects and secures your modern apps with unparalleled performance and global scale. Our cloud-native security services are backed by decades of experience protecting applications of every size and description for organizations of all sizes around the world.
These services leverage machine learning and globally sourced threat intelligence to protect against the ever-evolving threats that can potentially target applications. A layered and modular approach to security means you can acquire and implement only the controls you need, saving costs and boosting overall efficacy.
And with the F5 Distributed Cloud Platform, you can now deploy and run modern containerized apps with cloud-native management, consistent security, and end-to-end observability--from the data center to the cloud and the edge. Critical apps become increasingly available to a global audience with a common set of policies and services-- deployed efficiently and within minutes.
SOLUTION COMPONENTS
The F5 Distributed Cloud Web Application and API Protection (WAAP) solution operates across a global network of data centers, providing cloud-native application infrastructure and delivering robust and effective application and API protection services on a broad scale.
 Web Application Firewall (WAF): Protects web-based applications from a myriad of threats by acting as an intermediate proxy and inspecting application requests and responses to block and mitigate a broad spectrum of risks, including hacking, zero-day exploits, L7 denial of service, and more.
 API Protection: Guards application programming interfaces from threat actors that attempt to exploit them to facilitate a breach or other service outage. API protection performs similar functions as a WAF; however, traditional WAFs do not typically provide sufficient coverage for API protocols or data flows given their unique nature. This has left a lot of applications with serious coverage gaps if only a WAF has been deployed.
 Bot Defense: Manages and deflects malicious automation and brokers legitimate machine-to-machine communication to defend against business logic risks, such as web fraud, intellectual property theft, credential stuffing and account takeover, industrial espionage, denial of service, and more.
 DDoS Protection: Provides network-level shielding of volumetric denial-of-service attacks by filtering spoofed and malformed traffic, request floods, and other forms of abuse that attempt to overload your services and take them offline or disrupt them in a way that would result in a loss of customer confidence and access to services.

SECURING YOUR APPS MEANS PROTECTING YOUR BUSINESS, CUSTOMERS, AND REVENUE STREAMS.

You can seamlessly add any (or all) of these protections to any application regardless of where it is deployed--and then implement and evolve protections as needed to combat common threats like injection, cross-site-scripting, software vulnerabilities, and more.
In addition, F5 Distributed Cloud WAAP delivers operational insight and performance data for your globally distributed applications from a central location to boost overall efficacy, streamline support, and improve business intelligence metrics that help you grow and sustain your customers.
F5's centrally managed cloud platform offers other adjacent benefits as well, such as enabling easier audits, providing policy adherence for applications at scale, and ensuring that policies are appropriate for the risks and threats that applications face.
