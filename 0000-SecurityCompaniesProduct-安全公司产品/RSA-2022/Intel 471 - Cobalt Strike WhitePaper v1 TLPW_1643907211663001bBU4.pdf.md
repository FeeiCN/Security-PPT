Summary
Cobalt Strike is a suite of tools used by red teams in penetration testing tasks. The official website of the suite is Cobalt Strike. Features included and described at the website are:
 Reconnaissance: Discovers which client-side applications the target uses.  Attack packages: Allows hosting a web drive-by attack or transforms an innocent file into a
trojan horse.
 Spear-phishing: Uses templates to generate convincing phishing attacks and allows
sending emails.
 Post exploitation: Utilized the beacon component as the main payload that allows
execution of PowerShell scripts, logging keystrokes, taking screenshots, downloading files and spawning other payloads.
 Covert communication: Uses hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), hypertext transfer
protocol secure (HTTPS) and domain name system (DNS) to egress a network and supports peer-to-peer communications over server message block (SMB) protocol.
 Browser pivoting: Bypasses two-factor authentication (2FA) and accesses sites as a target.  Reporting and logging: Provides a timeline and a list of indicators from the activity. The
entire suite can be purchased and used as a malware tool set. The main component infecting the system is Beacon. Users of Cobalt Strike can also generate a loader component that injects Beacon into memory, this is also called a stager. The Cobalt Strike toolkit and decompiled source code have been leaked on separate occasions..

Capabilities and Behavior Overview
Capabilities  Downloads and executes additional payloads.  Installs additional plug-ins.  Starts socket secure internet protcol (SOCKS) proxy.  Allows remote access.  Logs keystrokes.  Makes screenshots.  Makes screencasts.  Takes webcam photos.  Steals browser form data.  Steals files from disk or network shared folders.  Steals stored credentials.
Behavior
Uses persistence mechanism.
 Encrypts controller communication.  Supports privilege escalation.  Supports multiple architectures.
Once the Loader component is executed on the victim's machine, it executes a PowerShell script with all the dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) required by Cobalt Strike. It first detects whether it's running in a x86 or x64 machine and then loads the appropriate DLL and executes it directly in the PowerShell memory. That prevents the file from being resident in the file system. Once the DLL is executed, the Beacon component is loaded and all features can be used.

Developers
This toolkit is a product of a company called Strategic Cyber LLC, which is owned by HelpSystems. All the information is public and is available at the official website. The main developer of the Cobalt Strike set of tools is Raphael Mudge and the coder has a YouTube channel with several tutorials.

Operators
Cobalt Strike is a commercial tool that is used by legitimate penetration testers. However, many open source reports have shown that the suite is also used by state-sponsored actors and cyber criminals, as well. Given that Cobalt Strike has been leaked and is available for purchase in underground forums, it is used by many operators.
We are not aware of a specific operator behind the use of such a toolkit as malware in our Intelligence Platform, Titan. But we regularly observe actors searching for people with knowledge about this tool set. Additionally, some groups known to use this software, that include:

APT19 CopyKittens CobaltGroup Leviathan

DarkHydru APT32 APT29 FIN6

The Intel 471 Malware intelligence team also found Cobalt Strike being dropped by other malware families, such as:

Bokbot aka IcedID Qbot aka Qakbot Bazar

Hancitor Trickbot

Infrastructure
Most of the controllers are dedicated servers spread around the world. Ports can be configured by different operators and it is not a closed set.
Since this tool set was leaked and also can be purchased publicly, there is no specific infrastructure.
Detection
Cobalt Strike uses a feature called Malleable-C2 to make network requests easily configurable and therefore hard to detect. However, we have developed some Yara signatures that can help with host-based detection. These rules are available upon the signing of a Mutual-NDA (M-NDA) in order to protect our methods.
Exploits
To spread the malware: We did not observe any exploits used to spread this malware.
Used by the malware: This malware can integrate public exploits to allow privilege escalation. There is a description about how to do that in the most recent Cobalt Strike version on the Cobalt Strike Blog:

Static Unpacking
The Cobalt Strike Loader has several obfuscation methods and deception techniques. Most of functions adopt a chained jump obfuscation technique. Instructions are mixed within the functions with jump instructions connecting consecutive instructions. A vast majority of functions are encrypted. The loader tries to keep as little code unencrypted at a time as possible. It accepts an address and number of bytes in EDI and ESI registers, respectively, and uses exclusive or (XOR) for all bytes in that range with a hard-coded byte.
We decrypted the chunks using an interactive disassembler (IDA) application programming interface (API):
def dexor_region(ea, amount): ea = 0x00400000 + ea for i in range(amount): b = idaapi.get_byte(ea + i) b ^= 0x45 diaapi.patch_byte(ea + i, b)
dexor_region(0x5c7e,0xc80)
To make static analysis more difficult, Cobalt Strike Loader copies some fragments of code from one place to another:

Unpacking section 1
The Loader leverages a few position-independent-code assembly techniques:

Unpacking section 2  Call $+5 jumps to the next instruction (as call $+5 instruction length is 5) but because it's a
call it also pushes the address onto the stack.
 Pop eax puts the next instruction address into the eax register.  Add eax, 3 calculates the string's address and can be now used as a normal rdata string.  Finally, after several decryption routines, the Loader overwrites its memory with the
decrypted shell code and then it resumes by calling the CreateThread API:

Unpacking section 3
The shell code uses a name hashing function, a common anti-analysis technique, in which the code first will locate the process environment block (PEB) from the thread information block (TIB). The shell code then will take each entry and normalize the string name by making all the characters in the module name uppercase. The characters of the module name then are rotated right by 13, added together and compared to a hard-coded value for "Kernel32. dll." It utilizes the "ror13AddHash32AddDll" hashing algorithm. The hash will be passed into a function that will hash each export of the DLL in question until a matching pair is found.

As another assembly technique, instead of executing the jmp eax, the eax controller first is pushed onto the stack.

Unpacking section 4
The main goal of the final shell code is to download and launch the Cobalt Strike Beacon shell code or Cobalt Strike Beacon DLL.
COBALT STRIKE BEACON SHELL CODE The Cobalt Strike Beacon shell code is not complicated. The only task it will perform is to decrypt the actual payload, which is the Cobalt Strike Beacon DLL using the initial decryption key in the offset 0x40. The shell code used about 40 bytes of code including the actual "MZ" header to jump or to execute its export function "_ReflectiveLoader@4."

Static unpacking
Cobalt Strike SMB Beacon
The SMB Beacon uses named pipes to communicate through a parent beacon. Named pipes are an interprocess communication mechanism on Windows operating systems. Named pipe communication between hosts is encapsulated in SMB. The "CreateNamedPipe" function will set up a named pipe and the "CreateFile" function connects to a named pipe. The "ReadFile" and "WriteFile" functions are used to read data from and send data through a named pipe. If we change the period in the pipe name to an IP address, the client will be able to communicate with a pipe on a remote system.

Malware behavior
The Cobalt Strike toolkit code continues to evolve and gain broader distribution.
BEHAVIOR OVERVIEW The loader component only has one job -- to download the Beacon DLL and execute it. Once the loader is executed on the victim's machine, it executes a PowerShell script with all the DLLs required by Cobalt Strike. It first detects whether it's running in a 32-bit or 64bit machine and then loads the appropriate DLL and executes it directly in the PowerShell memory. That prevents the file from being resident in the file system. Once the DLL is executed, the Beacon component is loaded and all features can be used.
PROCESS EXECUTION Cobalt Strike uses the Beacon component to gain a foothold on a target network. The main aim is to download and execute malicious payloads. It can be transmitted over HTTP, HTTPS, DNS or SMB protocol. The Beacon component also can modify its network signature using different command and control (C2) profiles.
