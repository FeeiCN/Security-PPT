IT Operations and Modern Workforce Evolution

Today we're settling into our third year of operating in a global health crisis. In 2020, organizations underwent sweeping change at an unprecedented pace and scale; by now, the most successful ones have embraced tools and strategies that let them thrive with the dynamic nature of modern workforces.
This is also our third year of producing this report. We surveyed industry professionals to find out how they are revamping their business processes and infrastructures to support sustainable operations, do their jobs more quickly and easily, and serve as strategic business drivers for their organizations. Many companies -- it turns out -- are pulling back from all-remote or mostly-remote working models, and instead adopting a more flexible, hybrid approach.
THE HYBRID APPROACH
These organizations are not simply moving back into the same old pre-pandemic office environments. Instead, they're turning to hybrid strategies that allow for some on-site and some remote work.
These new ways of working are making possible what we call the modern workforce. By nature, the modern workforce is:
 Hybrid. It's a "best of both worlds" approach that tries to capture the benefits of both in-office and remote work.
 Adaptable. Employers recognize that the ability to adapt to ever-changing conditions is a precondition for success in today's world.
 Empowered to be productive from anywhere, anytime. Enterprises strive to meet employees' psychological and technological needs so that they're able to do their best work, no matter where they are in the world.

Top 5 Stats from This Year's Survey
84%
of IT operations pros say there's room for improvement in their ability to manage endpoints.
60%
of organizations are using more than ten tools and solutions for endpoint management.
93%
of IT operations teams still rely on some degree of labor-intensive scripting to automate endpoint management.
10.5%
of organizations had not yet adopted or planned to adopt cloud-native endpoint management solutions last year.
99.1%
of organizations this year have already adopted cloud-native solutions for endpoint management or plan to do so within the next two years.

NEW ENTERPRISE CHALLENGES BRING NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR IT OPERATIONS
The modern workforce's dependence on both remote collaboration tools and on-premises hardware, and its need for on-site infrastructure and cloud and SaaS solutions that support work-from-home is effectively doubling IT operations teams' workload.
In essence, IT Operations is now being tasked with supporting both on-premises and remote-enabled infrastructures -- not just temporarily, but for the long haul. In a world where neither IT budgets nor staffing levels have seen significant growth, the scope of ITOps' responsibilities and the amount of work to be done has exploded. As a result, it's now imperative that IT operations teams turn to the right tools and solutions -- those that will automate manual tasks and propel efficiency without increasing headcount. This is really the only way IT Operations will be able to provide the 24x7 access to the data and IT resources that employees need in today's always-on business climate. It's also the only way that ITOps can be transformed into a strategic business driver that's vital to the enterprise's success.

WHY CLOUD-NATIVE MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN MEETING THE DEMANDS OF THE MODERN WORKFORCE
Modern IT infrastructures must support the needs of the modern workforce. Traditional on-premises infrastructures require ongoing physical maintenance, upgrades, troubleshooting and more. New cloud-based and distributed computing environments require new management capabilities and different skill sets. This increases the responsibilities IT operations teams must shoulder as they strive to meet the increasingly-complex needs of an agile and hybrid workforce reliant upon an ever-changing IT ecosystem.
To achieve the right level of efficiency, IT Operations needs powerful automated capabilities as well as a cloud-native approach that enables real-time visibility and control over dispersed and shifting IT environments. Cloud-native automation gives IT teams freedom from clunky tools, freedom from required VPNs, and freedom from dedicated infrastructure. Basically, it means ITOps can keep all their endpoints automatically configured, patched and secured -- anywhere in the world.
WHAT THE DATA SHOWS
Incorporating automation to bolster efficiency and support the modern workforce is no longer a new approach, and it's no longer optional. But how many of today's IT operations professionals recognize this fact? This survey explores how ITOps is adapting to hybrid working models, and what's needed to work faster, eliminate risk, and boost productivity.

Key Findings

 While enterprises are pulling back from the remote-first or remote-only workforce models that they adopted on-the-fly in 2020, a majority are moving towards hybrid or flexible models. Most are looking to do this for the long-term.
Survey results show that the number of organizations with all-remote or primarily remote workforces (80% or more of their employees work remotely) continues to decline. But there's steady growth in the number of organizations that have more than 40% of their employees working remotely at least some of the time. This is especially true for midmarket and somewhat larger companies, who are well positioned to capitalize on the benefits of today's SaaS-enabled, remote-butflexible world while also providing opportunities for their employees to come together in person.
 The majority of enterprise operations teams continue to struggle to manage endpoints efficiently, with most needing at least five disparate solutions or an unwieldy combination of tools and scripting to do so.
Nearly 84% of IT operations teams say there's significant room for improvement when it comes to their endpoint management capabilities. Many still rely on a sprawling and inefficient combination of endpoint management tools and scripts. The survey revealed that 60% of IT operations teams are currently using more than ten disparate solution sets for endpoint management. A whopping 84% rely on five or more separate tools. The result is a lack of visibility and effectiveness.

 As BYOD and cloud adoption increases, leveraging automation to make endpoint management easier is becoming more critical.
Survey insights show that remote endpoints, cloud containers and infrastructure, and employee-owned devices are the hardest IT infrastructure components for IT operations teams to manage. But adoption of all these things is trending up. Mobile device usage (predominantly BYOD) will likely skyrocket with the rollout of 5G technology, and cloud use continues to grow as the modern workforce's need for flexibility grows. The current trends promise to increase the need for solutions that will make it faster and easier for IT operations teams to manage more complex environments.
 Enterprises are embracing cloud-native solutions to empower their IT operations teams and remote workforces, and those that haven't begun their cloud-native journey yet are about to start.
Stakeholders recognize that the modern workforce is here to stay, and they see the value that cloud-native solutions have to offer. As a result, cloud-native adoption is increasing. Within two years, survey respondents expect to be using cloud-native solutions to meet nearly all of their endpoint management needs. It's likely that respondents understand that cloud-native approaches can give them better visibility, faster deployment, and much-needed scalability.

 Advanced automation (delivered by prebuilt tools that are easy to configure and manage at scale) remains underused and scripting overused, decreasing efficiencies and compounding the challenges that enterprise IT operations teams face.
When it comes to automated endpoint management, 90% of survey respondents are still using scripts, either alone or in conjunction with endpoint management tools. This practice is neither scalable nor sustainable, demanding considerable amounts of time, effort and programming skill. Excessive reliance upon scripting only compounds the challenges of remote IT management. Because scripting is labor-intensive, it also exacerbates the talent shortage.

The Modern Workforce is Here to Stay
Enterprises are moving away from makeshift and temporary work-from-home arrangements to longer-term flexible and hybrid working models. Today's employers continue to experiment as they try to optimize workplace experience and employee productivity, but there's little doubt that at least some remote work will be with us for the long haul.
HOW WIDESPREAD IS THE ADOPTION OF REMOTE AND HYBRID WORKING MODELS TODAY?
The number of organizations with a very large majority of employees working remotely full time decreased slightly since last year. However, adoption of hybrid models (in which around half of employees are working from home at least some of the time) is clearly on the rise. Survey findings show that IT operations teams will need to continue to support large numbers of remote workers for the foreseeable future, but they'll also need to manage on-premises environments.

FIGURE 1: AGILITY AND FLEXIBILITY EPITOMIZE THE MODERN WORKFORCE
What percentage of your organization's employees worked remotely (either part or full time) in 2021, and what percentage is expected to work remotely in the future? (n=456)

2021 2022

Less than 20%

20-39%

80% or more

The percentage of enterprises with 80% or more of their employees working remotely continues to decrease, from 23.9% in 2020, to 15.7% in 2021, all the way down to 9.8% today.
However, there's been growth in the number of organizations that have more than 40% of their employees working remotely at least some of the time. After a decrease from 2020's temporary high of 70.7%, this measure is again on the rise, up nearly 5% from 2021's numbers to 58.3%.
This increase was particularly prominent among midmarket companies (those with 5,000 - 9,999 employees). 82.9% of these organizations will be >40% remote in 2022-23.
In a historically tight labor market, organizations are trying to capitalize on the benefits of remote work (including attracting geographically diverse talent and retaining employees who seek flexibility as well as lower real-estate costs). But they're also striving to regain the benefits of on-site collaboration.

IS THE GROWING NEED TO SUPPORT HYBRID AND FLEXIBLE WORK ENVIRONMENTS CREATING NEW CHALLENGES FOR IT OPERATIONS?
Yes, it certainly is. On-premises workloads and devices are easier for IT operations teams to manage, but the increasingly mobile, flexible, and cloud-enabled workforce will bring more employee-owned devices and cloud containers and infrastructure, which will pose greater management challenges.
In general, endpoint management has become more difficult since last year's survey, with decreasing scores across all categories. What does this mean? Basically, organizations still lack the mature tools and processes they need to meet the needs of the modern workforce.

FIGURE 2: WHAT THE RISE OF THE MODERN WORKFORCE MEANS FOR ENDPOINT MANAGEMENT
On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being highest, rate your organization's overall ability to manage (i.e., monitor, configure, and inventory/update software for each of the following IT components. (n=456)

On-premises computers (desktops and laptops) On-premises containers
On-premises servers (physical and virtual) Remote computers (desktops and laptops)
Mobile devices (smartphones, tablets) Cloud infrastructure servers (Iaas) Cloud-hosted containers IoT/IIoT devices Bring-your-own devices (BYOD)

4.13 3.98 3.94 3.93 3.93 3.91 3.86 3.82 3.58

IT operations teams typically rely on familiar tools and workflows to manage on-premises devices, making the process simpler. As expected, survey respondents rated their ability to manage on-premises endpoints and infrastructures nearly one-quarter point higher than their ability to manage those that are remote.
Employee-owned and IoT devices were considered the most difficult to manage. BYOD devices often don't have agents installed and IoT devices are difficult to integrate with traditional endpoint management solutions. But cloud servers and cloud-hosted containers are thought to be nearly as difficult to manage as IoT/IIoT devices.
Meanwhile, adoption of cloud infrastructure and containers continues to accelerate. Gartner estimates that more than 70% of global organizations will be running two or more containerized applications in the cloud by 2023.1 This means that the challenges that IT operations teams face in managing diverse and distributed environments will only be amplified in 2022 and beyond.

IS THE MOVE TO THE MODERN WORKFORCE MOTIVATING ENTERPRISES TO INVEST IN TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL ENABLE ITOPS TO MANAGE IT SECURELY AND EFFICIENTLY?
Decision-makers are increasingly aware that the modern workforce needs continuous, reliable access to information and IT resources to remain productive and for the business is to succeed. They're also realizing that this requires investment in tools and solutions that make IT operations easier, faster, and more secure.

FIGURE 3: PLANNED AREAS OF INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT FOR 2022
On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being highest, rate the extent that having a modern workforce -- where users are not tied to a single location -- is influencing your organization to make the following changes in 2022. (n=456)

Increase automation of endpoint management tasks/processes
Increase visibility across endpoints to improve control & compliance
Invest in cloud-native solutions for endpoint management
Invest in a unified endpoint management solution
Invest in cloud-native applications
Replace VPNs for securely connecting remote endpoints
Outsource endpoint management to a managed services provider

3.93 3.91 3.87 3.87 3.86 3.82 3.66

Many participants are making investments to work "smarter not harder" in the future. Automation, cloud-native solutions, and unified platforms that will increase visibility, enhance control, and simplify compliance are all seen as important.
Organizations that adopt a single, cloud-native endpoint management tool are likely to see greater efficiencies and more time and cost savings than those that continue trying to manage the modern workforce's endpoints with multiple, specialized tools that were built for legacy IT environments.

The Current State of Enterprise IT Operations
Although there's growing awareness among stakeholders of the value automated and cloud-native solutions can provide, IT Operations continues to face headwinds. All too often, teams are tasked with managing IT environments when there are:
 too many disparate and inadequately integrated tools  too many manual processes  inadequate means of attaining visibility and control
Given the growing shift towards hybrid, flexible and agile ways of working among today's enterprises, there's greater need than ever for solutions that will enable IT Operations to fix vulnerabilities fast across diverse computing environments, collect data that pinpoints what needs to be done next, and report on tasks completed -- as well as those that are outstanding. Automating the management of these activities is huge.
DO IT OPERATIONS TEAMS STILL HAVE TOO MUCH TO DO IN TOO LITTLE TIME?
The answer is a most definite "yes!" Over 83% of respondents say that there's significant room for improvement in their endpoint management capabilities.

FIGURE 4: ADEQUACY OF CURRENT ENDPOINT MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES Describe your agreement with the following statement: "There is significant room for improvement when it comes to the effectiveness of our endpoint management capabilities." (n=456)

In today's world, IT operations teams in enterprises of all sizes are challenged. A large majority say there's significant room for improvement when it comes to their endpoint management capabilities, and this finding holds for enterprises of all sizes.
In fact, 100% of ITOps professionals employed by companies with 5,000 to 9,999 employees believe there's significant room for improvement in how they're managing endpoints today. It's worth noting that this group is also the one that has the most remote or hybrid work environments.
Without modern, automated solutions that allow IT Operations to manage, maintain, and secure remote endpoints efficiently at scale, teams will continue to struggle.

WHAT FACTORS ARE HINDERING IT OPERATIONS TEAMS' ABILITY TO MANAGE ENDPOINTS EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY?
The survey data shows that talent is in short supply. The biggest issues currently impacting IT Operations stem from the fact that too few people are being asked to manage too many different types of endpoints with too little visibility across them, and too little automation to help. The idea that employees are tasked with doing too much in too little time has become a familiar theme in the face of 2020 and 2021's historic labor force shortages, but its impact on IT Operations is stark.

FIGURE 5: IMPEDIMENTS TO PERFORMING ESSENTIAL ENDPOINT MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS
On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being highest, rate how the following negatively impact the ability to effectively manage your organization's endpoints. (n=456)

Insufficient staffing

Poor automation capabilities
Too many different types of endpoints being managed
Poor connectivity to endpoints that rely on VPN connections
Management tools are complex / not easy to use
Too many management servers, across multiple sites
Too many different management tools
Too many user-owned devices (i.e., BYOD) being managed
Shadow IT

3.04 2.99 2.98 2.95 2.93 2.93 2.88 2.84

It's no surprise that people -- enterprises' most valuable resource -- are in short supply. Insufficient staffing was most often cited as the biggest factor adversely impacting endpoint management by respondents. A lack of automation capabilities and poor visibility across endpoint devices are also holding significant numbers of IT operations teams back.
These problems tend to amplify one another: if an IT operations program is short-staffed, its need for intelligent automated solutions is greater, as is its need for extensive visibility (so that fewer people can see more of the environment) and for management tools that are easy to use and effective. The evolution of the modern workforce is only compounding the problem. Enterprises with >40% remote workers are more likely than others to struggle with insufficient staffing, lack of visibility, and inadequate automation.

ARE TODAY'S ENDPOINT MANAGEMENT TOOLS CONTRIBUTING TO ENTERPRISE SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE RISKS?
Yes. Participants voiced a resounding lack of confidence in their ability to know if their endpoints are securely configured across the entire enterprise.

FIGURE 6: IMPEDIMENTS TO MAINTAINING ONGOING COMPLIANCE
Describe your agreement with the following statement: "With our current endpoint management tools, it is difficult to quickly determine whether each endpoint is configured in accordance with corporate risk reduction policies and standards." (n=449)

14.9%

16.3%

19.6%

49.2%

Strongly agree Somewhat agree Somewhat disagree Strongly disagree

Two-thirds of respondents agree that confirming endpoint configuration status is tough. This lack of visibility is a prevalent issue across all organizations, but particularly troubles those with 5,000-9,999 employees (who are also more likely to have >40% of their employees working remotely).
Lack of visibility into endpoint configuration status is a highly problematic issue (more than 75% agree that it's a challenge) among organizations of a broad array of sizes (2,500 to 25,000 employees).
Once an organization reaches a certain size, it becomes increasingly difficult for IT Operations to maintain holistic and consistent visibility across its endpoint fleet, which introduces cybersecurity risk as well as the potential for misconfigured or improperly governed devices to slow down employee productivity.

IS INCREASING ADOPTION OF REMOTE WORK AND BYOD COMPOUNDING THE PROBLEM?
Yes. There's little doubt that remote and employee-owned devices are more challenging for IT Operations to manage.
The increasing diversity of computing environments also compounds the problem. Not only will modern workforces bring growing numbers of remote, mobile, and BYOD endpoints, but people will still work in the office some of the time. This means that tomorrow's IT operations teams will have to add growing numbers of tough-to-manage remote devices onto their current set of responsibilities.

Respondents rate their ability to manage on-premises devices significantly higher than their ability to manage remote devices. Mobile devices, which are most likely of all to be employee-owned, are even more challenging to manage efficiently.
With the rollout of 5G technology, mobile device usage is forecasted to speed up in 2022 and beyond. IDC Research predicts that more than 60% of U.S. employees will rely on mobile devices to complete their day-to-day work by the end of 2024.2 With the speed of growth in this area, the scope of the challenges it poses to IT Operations can be expected to intensify, too.

WHAT TOOLS AND SOLUTION SETS ARE IT OPERATIONS TEAMS RELYING ON TO MANAGE ENDPOINTS IN THE ENTERPRISE?
On average, survey respondents have ten or more disparate endpoint management tools and solution sets in current use. Not all are well integrated, which places a big administrative burden on IT operations teams. Because the requirements for effectively managing the modern workforce are already scaling well beyond IT Operations' current capabilities, the need for new management models and more streamlined capabilities is readily apparent.

7.0%

59.9%

Six out of ten survey respondents are using more than ten tools to manage their endpoint device fleet. Another quarter (24.3%) are using slightly fewer tools (5-9). Both groups likely struggle with tool sprawl and inefficiency.
Each additional management tool requires more training time and increases overall administrative overhead. Many teams have ended up with too many tools because legacy solutions lacked the capabilities to manage and monitor environments as they steadily increased in complexity (i.e., as new infrastructure components and device types were added over time).
This sort of tool sprawl is a problem of compounding challenges or diminishing returns: emerging technologies will continue to be adopted by enterprises -- and there's growing use of cloud services, IoT, and mobile devices -- so the inherent complexity of IT ecosystems will only increase in the future.
This means that it will become more important for enterprise IT Operations programs (which are, after all, short-staffed) to invest in streamlined approaches that let fewer professionals get more done in the same amount of time.

Moving IT Operations into an Efficient, Automated Future
Simply put, the current state of enterprise IT operations is unsustainable. Organizations will not be able to maintain visibility and control over tomorrow's increasingly agile, distributed and diverse computing ecosystems with today's sprawling sets of legacy tools and manual processes. The rise of the modern workforce increasingly demands that organizations invest in streamlined, automated solutions that were purpose-built for a cloud-native future.
HOW WELL ARE TODAY'S ENTERPRISE IT OPERATIONS TEAMS MAKING USE OF AUTOMATION?
There's considerable room for improvement. Nearly two-thirds of respondents describe their automation capabilities as "medium," indicating that the solutions still require manual intervention or workflows incorporate manual processes.

65.8% of respondents describe their endpoint management operations as having a "medium" level of automation, revealing that they're aware that more powerful automated capabilities are available, but their organizations have not yet started using them.
This finding begs the question of what respondents are referring to when they say "automation." We'll go into this next.

WHAT TYPES OF ENDPOINT MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES DO RESPONDENTS DESCRIBE AS "AUTOMATION"?
Both scripting -- which requires considerable investment of time, effort, and programming skill -- and the use of highly automated modern endpoint management solutions could be described as "automation." But the latter does far more to boost efficiency than the former.

FIGURE 10: HOW ENDPOINT MANAGEMENT IS BEING AUTOMATED

A very large portion of survey respondents (92.5%) are either wholly or partially relying on scripts to do their jobs. This practice is neither scalable nor sustainable, and it leads to some of the challenges that IT operations teams currently face: lack of visibility, shortage of skilled professionals relative to the amount of work to be done, and lack of confidence that configurations are maintained or patching is performed in a timely fashion.
Nearly half of respondents (45.7%) rely on an equal mix of scripts and endpoint management tools, a combined approach that may add up to even more inefficiencies, since it increases the number of tools to learn and the number of tedious manual processes (requiring development expertise) that must be completed.
Scripting is used most prevalently among organizations with 5,000-9,999 employees. These are the ones that are most likely to support remote-enabled or hybrid work environments. They're also most likely to face significant challenges with IT Operations' efficiency and effectiveness, particularly as cloud adoption proceeds and the organization scales.
Scripting comes with a hidden cost: processes are often poorly documented within organizations. This means that knowing how to write and manage scripts becomes "tribal knowledge" that only a limited subset of IT operations personnel has access to. Over the longer term, this approach isn't sustainable, leaving the organization poorly prepared for growth.
This is yet another problem that will only become more pressing as organizations move further along their workforce modernization and cloud journeys.

WHAT'S PREVENTING IT OPERATIONS FROM FURTHER ADVANCING AUTOMATED CAPABILITIES?
All too often, tools with inconsistent functionalities and poor integrations are the culprit. Budget is a major inhibitor as well.

FIGURE 11: ROADBLOCKS TO ACHIEVING AUTOMATED ENDPOINT MANAGEMENT

Fewer than half of all respondents (47.3%) have adequate budget to invest in a new solution -- one that will enable them to meet the demands of the modern workforce with their current resources. But IT operations teams are also struggling with solutions that are difficult to implement and configure, that don't cover all the device types the enterprise relies on, or that have inconsistent functionalities. These challenges, too, will only grow in severity as organizational computing environments become more complex in the future.

Use In Two Years 0.9%
18.4% 7.9% 20.9%
51.9%

Within two years, respondents expect to be using cloud-native solutions to meet nearly all of their endpoint management needs.
Not only has adoption increased since our 2021 survey (when 10.5% of organizations were neither using cloud-native solutions nor had planned for their adoption), but the pace of adoption has picked up as well. Today, fewer than 1% of organizations have no plans to adopt cloud-native endpoint management solutions in the future).
The results clearly show that respondents see the value in adopting cloud-native solutions over legacy on-premises tool sets or hybrid models. Cloud-native solutions:
 enable organizations to maintain security, compliance, and end user productivity even as they grow  provide real-time visibility and control over diverse, shifting IT environments  make IT Operations jobs easier with fast deployment and zero-touch maintenance
