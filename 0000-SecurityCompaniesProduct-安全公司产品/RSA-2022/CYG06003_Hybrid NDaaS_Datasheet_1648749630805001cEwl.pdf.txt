COST-EFFECTIVE HYBRID CLOUD DEFENSE

As traditional networks extend into public and private clouds, their fundamental definition changes as threat surfaces grow and new risks emerge.
CyGlass Network Defense as a Service (NDaaS) is a cost-effective network visibility, defense and compliance solution for cyber security teams with distributed, hybrid networks that lack the resources to operate 24X7 security operations centers.
The NDaaS platform learns and analyzes user and network behaviors wherever they emerge: the cloud, Active Directory, VPNs, firewalls, and network devices. It allows small teams to detect and respond to threats across on premise and cloud users, devices, and both cloud and network services. With CyGlass NDaaS, IT and security managers can see risk, stop threats, and prove compliance across their entire hybrid networks.

CyGlass uniquely correlates user, IP address, event, and risk level for network and cloud threats
Combining AI, machine learning, threat intelligence and layered security policies, CyGlass NDaaS reduces the massive volume of network traffic into easy to understand risk-based smart alerts, investigative views, and threat and compliance reports.

NDaaS Cost-Effectively Correlates Threat, IP and User Account

User event models include anomalous authentication, access, file usage, and file sharing in O365 environments

As a SaaS solution, CyGlass delivers enterprise-class capabilities such as the ability to correlate threat and risk level with user account and IP address for a fraction of the cost. The result is IT and security managers can quickly assess a threat, understand threat context and the devices and users involved, and effectively remediate an attack before damage is done. Remediation can include automatic blocking of IP addresses via firewall integration or user account blocking via AD integration.

WHAT IS NEW
CyGlass NDaaS risk and threat coverage now includes AD/AD-Azure users and O365 applications and AWS logs. Defenders can identify anomalous activities by device accessing and using AWS services, and correlate risk and threats across users, devices, and services.

CyGlass NDaaS Delivery Architecture: Complete Hybrid Cloud Visibility
CyGlass collects NetFlow, Syslog, AD Logs, and more via a data collector layer which ingests, parses, enriches, and correlates data into relevant formats and transmits it to the CyGlass AI engine via a secure SSH channel.
The CyGlass AI engine operates in an AWS Cloud and uses a mix of unsupervised machine learning and self-learning AI in a big data architecture complete with an integrated policy engine. This enables fast deployment of operational, threat, and compliance objectives and controls, which drive relevant analytics. AI models learn from the continuous flow of data mixed with human feedback.
