TESSIAN SOLUTIONS BRIEF
The Industry's Best-in-Class Email Data Loss Prevention Platform
Tessian's Email DLP suite provides security teams with an automated data protection solution to predict, prevent, detect and respond to data loss events caused by employees on email.

Legacy DLP Has Failed the Modern Enterprise
Legacy DLP solutions are quickly becoming an antiquated technology that isn't evolving to meet the needs of enterprise organizations. Most of these solutions rely on rules, create massive overhead for admin teams, and typically require constant manual fine-tuning to manage the myriad of false alerts. And data breaches continue to happen.
There is a better way with Tessian.

Solution Highlights
AUTOMATICALLY PREVENT ACCIDENTAL DATA LOSS Detect anomalies that indicate whether emails are being sent to the wrong person before it leaves your organization.
PREVENT DATA EXFILTRATION TO UNAUTHORIZED ACCOUNTS Automatically prevent data exfiltration via email to employee personal, unauthorized and non-business accounts.

POWERFUL POLICY ENGINE
Automatic and custom policy capabilities, and real-time visibility into data loss events, all without cumbersome, manual rules found in traditional DLP solutions.

ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
Protect against non-compliant activity and prevent users from sharing confidential data with non-business, personal addresses /unauthorized recipients; track and block compliance breaches in real-time.

DATA LOSS PREVENTION FOR THE HUMAN LAYER
The Problems with Legacy Data Protection Methods

Perhaps the most important aspect to consider with legacy data loss prevention solutions, is that the context of the data and attachments in emails are never thoroughly examined and understood, and security and awareness training is an ineffective tick-box exercise. Instead, cumbersome solutions based on known signatures are used, which don't account for unknown anomalies, or consider the friction and latency they produce when implemented. It also doesn't help that email infrastructure hasn't changed in three decades. Anytime we are securing information in legacy infrastructure, there are bound to be challenges. To prevent today's email security incidents, your security controls must bring the perimeter down to the employee level, so that you can understand their unique human behavior.
Here are the primary ways that DLP fails organizations in their data protection projects:
RULES-BASED DLP DOES NOT PROTECT AGAINST DATA EXFILTRATION Rules-based approaches simply cannot detect when emails are sent to the wrong people because there are no regex or pattern matches that can be applied. This level of protection requires context that DLP just doesn't have.
DLP FOCUSES ON A NEGATIVE CONTROL MODEL Legacy DLP is very strict with a binary approach to protecting data. It either allows it or blocks it. In a post-perimeter architecture, this is highly disruptive to business and unsustainable.
SLOW, CUMBERSOME AND NON-ADAPTIVE 85% of security leaders say DLP is admin-intensive. Legacy DLP must analyze all content and try to match it to block lists. This requires extensive analysis and the matching can be wrong as enterprise email content is constantly changing. As content and locations get more complex, legacy DLP can develop problems very quickly.
DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE TO IMPLEMENT While DLP may be regarded as a check-the-box solution for compliance, it is incredibly cumbersome, complex and expensive to deploy, often requiring huge spend in professional services to implement and maintain. Typical deployments are at least 12 months which make it hard to justify the return on investment vs. the security it provides.
LIMITED THREAT VISIBILITY Legacy DLP, including Email DLP, Endpoint DLP and Network DLP offer little to no visibility into personal email, webmail or other unauthorized email accounts.
PRONE TO FALSE POSITIVES DLP technologies have traditionally been prone to false positives, and as such, some of their best use cases are for controlling very predictable and structured content in very specific situations. In other words, it has extremely limited capabilities.

ASK YOURSELF...
 How do you make sure that employees are sending emails and attachments to the right people?
 How are you currently managing your blind spots?
 How often are you conducting security awareness training and how effective has it been?
 How long does it take to update your DLP policies?
 How effective are your DLP policies in preventing data exfiltration?
 What is the value of being able to report to the board and executives how technology is helping to reduce risk in the organization?
 What would be the benefit of implementing email DLP without impacting your users' current workflow?
