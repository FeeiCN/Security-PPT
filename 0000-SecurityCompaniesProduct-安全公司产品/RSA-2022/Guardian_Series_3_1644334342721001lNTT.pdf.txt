Centralized Management Platform

Centralized Cryptographic Infrastructure Management
Enterprise Management Capabilities and Business Insights for your Data Security Ecosystem
Ensuring a secure and reliable cryptographic infrastructure requires constant attention and adaptation to ever-changing throughput rates, emerging compliance mandates, and expanding functional requirements that incorporate a wide range of hardware security modules, key management servers, and more. Typically, management of these devices requires multiple administrators and key officers to regularly visit each device, often spread between geographically dispersed data centers. The Guardian Series 3 brings centralized management, monitoring, load balancing, audit logging, and reporting to your environment, giving you the freedom to focus on other priorities while complex cryptographic device management tasks are greatly reduced or even eliminated altogether.
The Guardian's robust monitoring engine tracks vital information for managed devices and groups in real-time. Fully customizable notifications delivered via SMTP, SNMP, SMS, and syslog let administrators oversee infrastructure health and gain actionable insights. Administrators can even customize and view graphical reports and analyses.
