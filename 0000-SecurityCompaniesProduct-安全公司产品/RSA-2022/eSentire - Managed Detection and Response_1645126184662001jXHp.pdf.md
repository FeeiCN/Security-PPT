How it works
We support your cyber program with a combination of cutting-edge machine learning XDR technology, threat hunting expertise and security operations leadership to mitigate your business risk, enable security at scale and drive your cyber program forward.

Machine: Powerful XDR Platform
The eSentire Atlas XDR Cloud Platform offers unmatched visibility
and employs patented machine learning to detect and to respond to
threats in real time.

and threat disruption.

Operations: Proven Processes
Effective and efficient analysis, investigation, escalation and response processes refined over a two-decade history of delivering Managed Detection and Response
to high-value targets.

Multi-Signal MDR
At eSentire we believe a multi-signal approach is paramount to protecting your complete attack surface. We ingest network, endpoint, log, cloud, insider and vulnerability data to enable complete attack surface visibility, and drive deeper investigations, in order to strengthen the speed and completeness of our response capability. We correlate indicators of compromise and early detections between multiple signals, and our 24/7 SOC Analysts and Elite Threat Hunters quickly investigate, contain, and enforce response actions against advanced persistent threats that bypass traditional security measures.
 Network - Defend brute force attacks, active intrusions and unauthorized scans  Endpoint - Protect assets from ransomware, trojans, rootkits and more  Log - Intelligence and visibility across AWS, O365, GCP, DevOps and more  Cloud - Configuration escalations, policy & posture management  Insider Threat - Detects malicious insider behavior leveraging Machine Learning models
Whether your environment is in the cloud, on-premises or somewhere in between we have the visibility to see what other MDR providers will miss.

eSentire MDR is powered by Atlas XDR
Without a comprehensive, cloud-native XDR platform with adaptive machine learning, MDR services can't monitor the whole threat surface, can't make sense of the overwhelming volume of threat signals and can't respond fast enough to stop skilled attackers.
At eSentire, we're proud to be pioneers in delivering effective, efficient and scalable cybersecurity solutions. We were the first MDR vendor to introduce a cloud-native XDR platform--Atlas--providing security, reliability and redundancy at scale and on demand, so our services can grow with your business. It's not a bolt-on or add on, the Atlas XDR platform is at the core of eSentire MDR.
