Solution Brief

LogicHub for Community Banks and Credit Unions
Automation-driven managed detection and response

Organizations with fewer than 1,000 employees are disproportionately damaged by data breaches. According to the 2019 Cost of a Data Breach Report from the Ponemon Institute, an average data breach costs:  $3,500 per employee for small organization (<1000
employees)
Versus
 $210 per employee for large organizations (>25,000 employees)
And average costs are 50% higher for financial institutions. As a smaller organization, your proportional risk is substantially higher than a large bank, and you still need to deliver the same level of protection, including:
 Continuous monitoring for compliance
 24x7 protection from advanced threats
 Documented incident response processes
But without the resources to fully staff and operate a 24x7 enterprise SOC, it's difficult for your team to build an effective security operations program and keep up with the overwhelming volume of potential threats and associate alerts on your own.

What You Need  Cost effective, 24x7 protection from
advanced threats
 Continuous monitoring of endpoint, network and user related log and event data
 Formal incident response processes that meet industry requirements
What LogicHub Delivers  24x7 expert detection and response
services mapped to MITRE ATT&CK

 Security outcomes that eliminate alert fatigue and empower your security team
