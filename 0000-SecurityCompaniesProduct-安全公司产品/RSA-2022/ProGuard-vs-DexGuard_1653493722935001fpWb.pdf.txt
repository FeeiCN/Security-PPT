Open Source Java/Kotlin Optimization Tool
An open source solution, ProGuard can be used free of charge to optimize your Java/Kotlin bytecode. ProGuard makes Java, Kotlin and Android applications up to 90% smaller and up to 20% faster.
ProGuard also provides minimal protection against reverse engineering by obfuscating the names of classes, fields, and methods. However, most Android developers find they need additional security protection beyond the basics ProGuard provides. That's where DexGuard comes in.

Advanced Android App Protection
Developed by the creators of ProGuard, DexGuard includes all ProGuard features plus advanced protection against reverse engineering and hacking.
Android applications and SDKs are easy to reverseengineer, which opens up opportunities for various forms of abuse, including intellectual property theft, credential harvesting, tampering, and cloning.
DexGuard hardens both Android (Java, Kotlin) and cross-platform (Cordova, Ionic, React Native, Unity) code, and enables applications to defend themselves at runtime. It is backward compatible with ProGuard rules and configurations, making upgrades simple.

Choose proactive Android app security
More than 80% of organizations said they are at risk from mobile security threats, and 69% said those risks increased in the last year (Verizon Mobile Security Index 2019). Get proactive about advanced mobile app protection with DexGuard.
