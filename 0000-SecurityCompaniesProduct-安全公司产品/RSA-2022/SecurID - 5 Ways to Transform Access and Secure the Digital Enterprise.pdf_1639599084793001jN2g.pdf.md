Five Ways To Transform Access and Secure the Digital Enterprise

Secure Access Challenges for Today's Digital Enterprise
The days of securing a well-defined perimeter around your organization are gone. The cloud, mobile technologies, the internet of things (IoT) and diverse user groups freely exchange data across digital ecosystems, network and economies. This fluidity, however, means that organizations must secure access at multiple points throughout the organization, or risk letting in intruders seeking to hijack data. To manage the increasingly diverse digital landscape of mobile user populations, hybrid environments and BYOD programs, IT and security managers need to move beyond usernames and passwords, expanding their use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) to help provide secure and convenient access to the critical data and systems users need.

Access Tranformation Starts With Authentication
The path to achieving secure access must rely on solutions that work everywhere, from ground to cloud. They must work with other parts of the security ecosystem to thwart threats. And they must make it harder for attackers to get in and do damage, while making it easier for legitimate users to access to the resources they need.

Protecting against attacks means making authentication:
Pervasive Enabling secure access at all points across applications, devices, users
and environments.
Connected Sharing information and insights across the security ecosystem to
strengthen security.
Continuous Constantly collecting and analyzing
information to stop attacks.
And doing it all without adding friction to the user experience.

Five Focus Areas for Secure Access Transformation
Here are five common ways you can transform access with multi-factor authentication (MFA) throughout your organization:

Cloud applications

Privileged access

VPN access

Custom and legacy apps with next-generation firewalls

Digital workspaces

Read on to learn how MFA can transform how you provide secure access--to any application, from any device, anywhere, at any time.

Securing Cloud Applications
Third-party cloud applications such as Microsoft Office 365, Salesforce and Workday are critical productivity tools, used daily by employees and vendors alike. When you look at all the sensitive data that sits in these applications--from personally identifiable information (PII) and health information to payment data and corporate secrets--it's clear that it needs to be protected. And access security must do so without disrupting your employees' ability to do their jobs. Plus, some emerging regulations and corporate policies may require that you protect this data with something stronger than a password.
Three benefits of using MFA to secure access to cloud applications:
Provide users a choice of authentication methods. Allow users to use methods most convenient for them, such as mobile-optimized MFA, including push-toapprove and biometrics.
Challenge only according to the level of risk. Ask for step-up authentication only when a user or situation presents a risk, based on user and risk analytics further reducing access friction.
Make it easy for users and administrators. Many cloud application providers also offer MFA capabilities, but that means more applications and tools for the end user to remember, and more MFA solutions for you to manage. Keep it simple with one authentication solution that covers all your apps, from the ground to the cloud.

Protecting the Most Critical Access Within the Business
While any compromised identity can have real consequences for organizations, privileged accounts pose the greatest security threat. In the wrong hands, privileged credentials can allow attackers to take control of IT infrastructure, disable security controls, steal confidential information and commit fraud. Many organizations have implemented tools and processes for managing privileged credentials, including Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions and password vaults. That's a big step toward more secure data. What's surprising is how many organizations using PAM to protect privileged credentials still rely on usernames and passwords to secure those vaults and tools.
Three steps to strengthen identity assurance with privileged users:
Require strong authentication with MFA to protect access to PAM solutions, plus critical infrastructure including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, firewalls, and VPN.
Combine MFA with a robust risk and behavioral analytics engine to enhance your security posture and detect suspicious access attempts on these critical assets.
Think beyond traditional admin accounts to include privileged accounts across third-party applications and cloud providers--wherever users have access to sensitive and privileged assets.

34%
of identity-related breaches in a 2020 survey involved privileged users'
identities--a higher percentage than third-party and non-human identities2

Evolving Access To the VPN
Back in the day, when only a handful of users accessed your VPN, it was easy to control access and enhance security; you may have deployed a token to that core group. Today, with more and more people using VPNs, too many organizations still rely on basic usernames and passwords. And that leaves you vulnerable. Instead, you need to provide easy, frictionless and secure access to a diverse and growing population of VPN users--including employees, contractors, vendors, customers, audit team members, and partners. And you must have confidence that they are who they say they are, and have the appropriate levels of access.
Three keys to modernizing access to your VPN:
Use modern MFA tools, such as push-to-approve authentication and biometrics, on users' mobile devices for easy, secure access.
Leverage risk and behavior analytics to provide more complete identity assurance that users are who they say they are.
Keep it simple for users by providing one authentication solution for all access points, including VPN, as well as applications that live outside the VPN like cloud and third-party apps.

Securing Custom and Legacy Apps With Next-Generation Firewalls
Behind the firewall, custom and legacy applications contain critical information needed to run the business. As authentication becomes more pervasive, you also need to evaluate security inside the firewall, assessing how each application is protected. If a username and password gets compromised, hackers can move laterally throughout the network, often undetected, accessing multiple critical applications. Historically, it's been difficult and costly to secure access to custom and legacy apps using MFA. But now there's a way to give them the same level of protection, integrating MFA with next-generation firewalls to apply MFA to these legacy apps.
Three ways to improve custom and legacy app security:
Secure access at the network level. This approach gives you more control over access, without spending the time and money required to develop integrations for each legacy or custom app.
Protect against compromised credentials. Network-level MFA covers all applications, with more protection against stolen or compromised usernames and passwords. It also helps provide the security you need to better comply with regulatory compliance mandates, including PCI DSS and HIPAA.
Strengthen firewall administration. Group firewall administrators into low, medium and high assurance levels based on their roles and permissions.

Protecting Digital Workspaces
To help deliver and manage access to any app on any device, organizations are turning to digital workspaces like VMware Workspace One. Add MFA to the front door of these digital workspaces to provide strong security as users access the mobile apps they need to stay connected and productive. Use additional step up authentication based on the level of risk of the application and individual to further hone access and reduce user friction.
Three steps to start securing your digital workspaces:
Reduce user friction by challenging users based only on the level of risk each poses. Use machine learning to understand behaviors. Let in User A only when you're confident it really is User A. Extend this convenience to all users, while maintaining strong security.
Provide simple, convenient access. When you do have to step up and ask for additional authentication, leverage modern mobile authentication for simple access. Give users a consumer-simple experience that doesn't impede productivity.
Use a single MFA solution. Cover all your digital workspace, on-premises and cloud security needs with one solution vs. various point authentication solutions that can cause user confusion and duplicative administration.
