Cisco Secure Hybrid Work Solution
Enable security everywhere so you can empower anywhere
The Cisco Secure Hybrid Work solution unifies protection at scale, making it easy to verify users and devices, enable secure access, and defend hybrid workers at anytime from anywhere. With security that works together, this integrated solution helps accelerate your business success to deliver the power of Secure Access by Duo, AnyConnect, Umbrella, Secure Endpoint, and Secure Email Cloud Mailbox.

With Cisco Secure Hybrid Work, you have a simple, unifying solution to enable security everywhere and empower work anywhere.

After managing the sudden switch to remote work in 2020, organizations are making a more permanent transition into the flexible hybrid workforce. Cisco's hybrid workplace survey found that 77% of larger organizations are looking to increase their work flexibility while 58% of employees plan on working from home for 8 or more days each month.

A hybrid workforce comes with its own challenges. The FBI found that cybersecurity attacks rose by 3-4x as a result of the transition to remote work in 2020. In addition, experts predict that ransomware will cost the world up to $20 billion in 2021 and is expected to be a greater concern with the hybrid work model. As a result, you'll need to rapidly scale your security to account for the massive influx of remote and hybrid workers while simplifying and unifying your IT systems. Cisco Secure can help.
