Insurance Company Overcomes Backend Issues of Growth by M&A
Today's customers expect more from their digital experience and for established companies, meeting those expectations can be extremely difficult--especially if they've grown their portfolio of services through mergers and acquisitions. One insurance giant offered services including life insurance, mutual funds, annuities, pension & retirement-related services, asset management, and banking. Providing a seamless customer experience across these diverse service areas was a critical component of its online strategy--but accomplishing that goal was difficult. Many of its customers had multiple accounts across different business service areas--which meant logging in with separate credentials to access each site. This complex, customer-unfriendly system made it hard to compete with digital-native insurance providers built from the ground up to offer single sign-on to customers. It was critical that they obtain a complete 360-degree view of each customer's profile to simplify access and preferences, while enabling customers to use a single username and password to access all services and ensuring the robust security their customers expected.

The Challenge
 Historically, customers registered for services through different platforms, each with its own user store, which meant customers had to login multiple times to access services, which meant logging in multiple times while remembering different usernames and passwords
 Self-service/Password Reset (SSPR) functions happened in BU applications, with no central place for changes, compounding an already difficult user experience
 The company wanted to enable customers to "log in once and log in everywhere," while also allowing each business unit to shift to the new system on its own schedule

The Solution
 RadiantOne made it easy to quickly virtualize every identity store, creating a logical, rationalized identity layer to route authentication and authorization requests, so users no longer need to create a new identity or re-register to access different types of content
 They consolidated multiple "identities" for each user across applications and backend data stores, while centralizing SSPR for a more consistent customer experience
 RadiantOne was the only solution that gave application owners time to migrate at their own pace--as well as a way to respond quickly to new demands and opportunities

The Results
The company installed RadiantOne Intelligent Identity Data Platform to act as a hub for authentication, authorization, and profile preferences to support their expanding WAM, Federation, and SSO initiatives. Now customers are able to sign in to one platform and enjoy a seamless experience across most of the company's services--and as each application owner migrates to the new system, the customer experience gets even better.
 With RadiantOne, the company was finally able to offer customers a single set of credentials for a much cleaner user experience, increasing customer retention and acquisition
 It was also able to add additional Identity & Access Management capabilities, while consolidating repositories

 RadiantOne helped the insurance giant reduce customer service costs, making it easier for customers to access their assets and interact with each service area--and migration to this new system is fast and easy and can happen on the appropriate timeline for each business unit
