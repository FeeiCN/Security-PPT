The Visibility Factor in Cloud Security:
What Every Organization Must Understand Before Migrating to the Cloud

This cloud security "primer" addresses only one key lesson about migrating to the cloud, because it's the most crucial one to know and understand:
Without visibility, cloud security is impossible.
Unfortunately, many organizations are learning this lesson the hard way. That's especially true for those that have moved fast to adopt and expand their use of the cloud during the coronavirus pandemic to accelerate digital transformation, support remote workers, and deploy new business models. In their haste, these organizations failed to prioritize security appropriately, and have created many blind spots and security gaps that now expose their data, users, and systems to risks, and which attackers are actively seeking to exploit.
In a study Ponemon Institute conducted for ReliaQuest1, more than half (54%) of enterprises surveyed said the adoption of cloud environments has created blind spots that make them vulnerable to a data breach. And according to the 2021 Cloud Security Report2 from the International Information System Security Certification Consortium (ISC)2, 96% of organizations are moderately to extremely concerned about the state of their cloud security. Many security teams now face the daunting challenge of trying to find and fix cloud security issues before they become -- or invite -- more serious problems.
Standing in the way of their success is a lack of visibility. The Ponemon study found that 60% of organizations lack integrated visibility into their cloud and on-premises solutions -- and it's proving to be a significant obstacle to security teams implementing effective threat detection and investigation practices that could strengthen cloud security. An issue that dovetails into this challenge for many organizations, according to Ponemon's research, is the difficulty they face trying to integrate data sources so they can gain visibility across their multicloud and hybrid cloud deployments.

Securing cloud environments is indeed more difficult when organizations work with multiple providers and maintain hybrid cloud environments. Most enterprises today rely on a mix of cloud platforms and services like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications to support their everyday operations. These multicloud environments are very complex -- and managing them is an onerous task for IT and security teams.

AS CLOUD ADOPTION EXPANDS, SO DOES THE ATTACK SURFACE
Despite these challenges, many organizations are moving full-steam ahead with plans to widen their embrace of cloud -- because they must. Some organizations seek to build on their success using cloud resources and services during the COVID-19 pandemic not only to survive, but also to seize new opportunities and grow. Meanwhile, other organizations are racing to catch up with their more digitally mature peers after realizing their digital transformation inertia prior to the crisis has prevented them from being agile and resilient. And now, that lack of digital maturity threatens their ability to compete effectively in the post-pandemic recovery.

Research for the 2021 Cloud Security Report2 from the (ISC)2 found that more than half (55%) of organizations are likely or very likely to deploy a new cloud security solution in the coming year.

And Gartner predicts that by 2026, public cloud spending will exceed 45% of all enterprise IT spending -- up from less than 17% in 2021.

While the pressure is on to implement more

cloud resources and services, organizations

aren't likely to see a positive return on their

investment if they suffer a major security

incident. And the risk of that happening

is very high if cloud security is weak.

According to research conducted by IDC,

98% of companies have experienced a

cloud data breach in the past 18 months.

So, what are the cloud security risks that could lead to a costly data breach or other security incident for an organization? Following are seven key threat types related to cloud environments:

MISCONFIGURATIONS Misconfigurations expand the attack surface and leave cloud resources vulnerable to attack
PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE APIS These APIs can be lucrative targets for attackers, and can result in account takeovers, carding attacks, fake logins, and more.

DATA EXFILTRATION This is a top concern for organizations that handle personally identifiable information (PII), personal health information (PHI), and payment card information (PCI) data

INFILTRATION Attackers will hijack accounts and infiltrate networks or systems to attempt to penetrate an organization's cloud services.

DISRUPTION Malicious actors will disrupt critical services or applications using either distributed denial of service (DDoS), ransomware, or other attack techniques.

EXPLOITATION These attack methods include metadata service abuse, resource hijacking, backdoors, and more.

ABNORMAL AUTHENTICATION SCENARIOS

These scenarios, often seen with SaaS applications, include the

compromise of OAuth applications or user accounts, which can

lead to data compromise.

Why a Holistic View of Cloud Security Is a Must
Organizations can't manage those various threat types effectively, or migrate to the cloud with confidence, without a holistic view of all their cloud resources and services. Cloud security also requires organizations to consider how best to secure and monitor every cloud environment, application or service the business uses. Typically, that involves employing an array of tools from various vendors and data from different resources, such as:

Application health data
Logs (e.g., WAF, Kubernetes)
Endpoint Detection and Response
(EDR) solutions

Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) solutions
Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) solutions
Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) solutions

To respond efficiently and effectively to relevant alerts and other intelligence from these tools and resources, security teams must be able to consolidate disparate pools of data into one place for monitoring, detection and response. They also require the ability to inject telemetry from cloud-specific tools and unify it with data from traditional sources to develop that one, cohesive, holistic picture of threats across all tools and attack surfaces.
Also, because threats are changing and becoming more complex all the time -- as are the cloud environments themselves -- security teams are under constant pressure to configure and reconfigure critical controls and secure architecture practices so they can address risks and quickly detect attcks. And they need to monitor these environments with speed and efficiency, 24/7/365.

Obviously, organizations need help to make all of that happen -- but it won't come from their cloud providers. Many organizations have been taken off guard by the shared responsibility "surprise" -- when they discover that their cloud vendors don't provide the visibility and monitoring of cloud environments they had expected (i.e., assumed). They didn't fully understand, until after moving critical infrastructure to the public cloud, that cloud security is a shared responsibility between providers and their customers. And that model can vary by provider and service type.
ReliaQuest GreyMatter helps organizations transcend these challenges by providing the visibility into the cloud they need to build a best-in-class cloud security program, no matter whether they're using AWS, Microsoft Azure, GCP, or all of the above.
