Mimecast Email Security
Cloud-based protection at your email perimeter and inside your network and organization

Mimecast Email Security is a cloud service designed to protect your organization and your users from the threats that lurk within business email communications. Whether the email is inbound, outbound, or internal, Mimecast Email Security defends against malicious URLs, weaponized attachments, impersonation attacks, spam and viruses. Combined with visibility of internal email threats, automatic remediation and threat intelligence, Mimecast helps your email and security teams strengthen your cyber resilience.
The Mimecast Email Security Suite includes:
Mimecast Targeted Threat Protection (TTP): A suite of services delivering inspection of inbound, outbound and internal emails to help detect and fight phishing, ransomware, impersonation attempts, malicious URLs, weaponized attachments, and internal compromise.
Content Control & Data Loss Prevention (DLP): Protection against the loss of intellectual property, customer data and other sensitive information. Content policies can be created and applied to inbound, outbound and internal traffic in real-time.
Spam and Virus Protection: Stops infected email from reaching the network and impacting users productivity. Mimecast offers 100 percent antivirus and 99.5 percent anti-spam SLAs, removing threats in the cloud before they reach your network.

Key Benefits:
 Mitigate the risk of spear-phishing and advanced threats in email
 Removes the graymail burden for users
 Protects users against social engineering and impersonation attacks
 Detects and blocks attacks from both external and internal threat actors / compromised users
 All customers are instantly protected based on blocking a threat for just one
 Multi-tenant cloud delivers always up-todate defenses
 Remediates potential threats/undesirable emails post-delivery, automatically or manually
 Message Insights provides inspection results for each processed email
 Delivers deep insights on malware attacks targeting your organization and, through Threat Feed, Mimecast's Threat Intelligence API, in your geographical region
 Enables automated TLS email encryption

Mimecast Threat Remediation: Automatic or manual removal of unsafe, undesirable, or malicious content post-delivery, based on the latest intelligence and analysis. Customers with Internal Email Protect (IEP) can leverage Threat Feed (the threat intelligence API) to search for, remove or restore emails using existing security tools, such as a SOAR platform.
Mimecast Threat Intelligence: Provides actionable insight into the cyberthreats your organization faces, with expert analysis of the attacks our services detect. The Threat Dashboard provides information on users who are most at-risk, malware origin by geolocation, and recently observed threats. It allows search by message ID and file hash and returns information about specific threats, which can also be surfaced in your SIEM or SOAR using the Threat Feed API.
Mimecast Browser Isolation: Prevents sensitive information phishing and contains malware safely away from the user's computer or device. When a user clicks a new, uncategorized embedded URL that has passed all other inspection checks, the target web page is opened in a remote browser in the Mimecast cloud and only safe video is streamed to the user.
Always-on security
Anti-spam and anti-virus protection, data loss prevention, URL inspection, safe-file conversion, impersonation protection, malware blocking, internal monitoring with threat intelligence, and graymail control for email are all delivered as part of a single unified solution. Mimecast's global threat researchers and Security Operations Center analysts and advanced email security technology help to ensure that you remain protected against the latest threats, while delivering deeper insight on those targeting your organization. Once in place, Mimecast will secure your users' inboxes, protecting them from cyberthreats, leaving you to focus on delivering core business services.

Advanced Threat Protection
Mimecast's massively scalable email security services are built on the Mime|OS cloud platform. Email related threats such as malware, spam, spear-phishing, and other attacks are stopped before they reach your email system. This reduces risk to your users and improves the performance of your email system. Mimecast Targeted Threat Protection addresses the risk of spear-phishing and targeted attacks in email. Every URL in all inbound email is rewritten to point to Mimecast's cloud, protecting users from accessing phishing sites and those containing malware.
Email attachments undergo static file analysis and can also be pre-emptively scanned in a secure, full-system emulation sandbox, as well as converted to safe file formats, to protect against weaponized attachments. Administrators can determine what Mimecast knows about specific threats by searching for specific files or messages, either directly through Mimecast's Administration Console, or using the tools available in their SIEM, TIP or SOAR.*
Users are equally protected from social engineering and email impersonation attacks, with a sophisticated set of security checks designed to detect and stop spoofing, supply chain impersonation, homoglyph/homograph impersonation and fraudulent requests. Users can also be alerted to suspicious emails to prevent data loss.
Internal and outbound email is analyzed for malicious URLs and attachments as well as content (DLP) to prevent compromised, careless, or malicious users from spreading attacks within an organization or to customers and partners. With the continuous rechecking of emails that exist in your environment, remediation of unsafe, unwanted, or malicious content can be enforced automatically or manually by the administrator.
