OUTCOMES

"In the beginning of 2020, we saw a major increase in ransomware hitting our third
parties."

"In 2020, we notified 350 organizations that they were compromised or at risk of being compromised" This included organizations outside the client's
ecosystem.

"For other sources, we would have to vet new feeds to make
sure they are clean and to monitor existing feeds."

" ... with what we glean from Recon, we have been able to go
from 15 feeds to 5 feeds. In addition, with Recon, we are fed information the same day it is
utilized"*

"We wanted to get data from multiple sources and come up with our own conclusions instead of just learning the
entities' point of view."*

"Recon has allowed us to pay more attention to the [bad] actors instead of reading reports about [them]. It has allowed us to create our own intelligence"

"There's a time-consuming process that comes with a compromise of our third
parties."

"When [a third party is] compromised, we identify it with Recon, then tell [the third party] how [the threat actor] got in ... and what they need to do to stop them
immediately"
