ANOMALI TARGETED THREAT MONITORING

OVERVIEW
Organizations face constant threats from sophisticated threat actors targeting their brand to inflict damage, making it harder for security teams to keep up and defend their brand from these attacks.
Unfortunately, many of the current tools take a reactive approach in identifying threats, leaving organizations to rely too much on their perimeter defenses to detect or stop attacks.
Anomali Targeted Threat Monitoring helps identify and defend against targeted attacks by continuously monitoring the threat landscape to alert on relevant threats and enable you to act quickly.
Anomali Targeted Threat Monitoring enables security teams to:
 Detect attacker infrastructure before it is operationalized
 Disrupt an attacker's ability to create an outbound channel
 Prevent harvesting and exfiltration of data
 Take action to minimize risk and potential damage

KEY BENEFITS

 Continuously monitor domains for cybersquatters and domain hijacking to prevent phishing and malware attacks
 Increase visibility into external threats to prevent sensitive data leaks and help mitigate risk before damage can occur.
