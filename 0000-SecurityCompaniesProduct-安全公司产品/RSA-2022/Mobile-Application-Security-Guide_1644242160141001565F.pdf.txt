INTRODUCTION
Mobile applications are the cornerstone of our mobile-first world. They are now a necessity for companies to communicate and offer services to their workforce, clients and partners. But with that necessity comes risk. Mobile apps are trusted with sensitive data, while not always being prepared to face the hostile environment they'll run in. Indeed, mobile applications are cybercriminals favored vector to compromise smartphones, with 78% of data breaches on mobile originating from them. The mobile app attack surface is composed of malwares, representing the tip of the iceberg, and numerous silent leaky behaviors and vulnerabilities. Today, governments and authorities are reinforcing the legal framework applying to mobility, with data protection laws that precisely require to protect mobile applications to prevent data theft and exfiltration. In the meantime, consumers are getting more concerned about how their personal information is handled, expecting companies to implement the means necessary to avoid their leakage. Organizations releasing a mobile application are responsible for its protection across its lifecycle. Although, implementing the proper security practices at the right moment isn't always easy, as applications' time-to-market is often rushed by urgent business needs and are not conducted as thoroughly as developers and security teams want. This guide goes through the risks an unsecure mobile app is exposed to, the legal framework it has to comply with and finally how to secure an app from development to operation stages.
Mobile application security is about delivering leakage free, vulnerability free, tamper proof and self-protecting mobile apps.

MOBILE APPLICATION ATTACK SURFACE

Mobile apps can feature a malware, hence being inherently malicious or they can be sane and either leak the data they manipulate or be vulnerable to attacks. In all these cases, and whether they are developed in-house or by third parties, mobile applications have the power to strongly hurt data privacy.
The statistics below are extracted from Pradeo's global mobile security report 2021.
Internal threats

Unexpected behaviors

Vulnerabilities

A mobile application can perform unwanted actions because of the external libraries it hosts (79% of mobile applications embed thirdparty libraries) or as a result of a development negligence between testing and production. Both can lead to silent data leakage and potentially unwanted actions.

A vulnerability comes from either the application's source code or from the libraries it hosts. To help developers, hundreds of code vulnerabilities are referenced by the US National Vulnerability Database, the OWASP mobile security project, US-CERT, etc. However, 57% of apps have vulnerabilities exposing them to data leakage and attacks such as Man-In-The-Middle, Denial of Service, etc.

External threats

Malwares

Targeted attacks

A malware is specifically designed to disrupt, damage, or gain access to a device or data. A malware's lifecycle has different stages: At first, its combination of functionalities is new and not classified in any antivirus database. Then, it starts getting recognition and is attributed with a name and a viral signature. To stay under the radar, cybercriminals keep renewing their malwares. 94% of the malwares detected by Pradeo Security in 2020 are unknown to antivirus databases.

Mobile applications can be specifically targeted by cybercriminals. It is often the case for mobile banking apps that are mimicked by banking trojan to coax users into providing sensitive details, or that are cloned and used to illicitly communicate with the bank's server.
Popular applications are also often cloned and tampered to create MOD (modified applications) that are copies of original applications to which code is injected by third-party/unofficial developers to unlock premium subscription and divert them to malicious activities.

MOBILE APPLICATION LEGAL FRAMEWORK
Organizations are expected to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of any sensitive data they process and transactions they perform. Mobile applications, as any other system processing sensitive information, are required to comply with data privacy laws and specific security standards enforced in highly regulated industries such as finance or healthcare. Here are some key requirements that apply to mobile applications.
Personal data
Personal data privacy regulations are in effect in various regions of the world, such as the GDPR (EU), FTC Act (USA), PIPEDA (Canada), DPA (UK), NDB (Australia), etc. These regulations tend to converge towards the same global guidelines, by asking organizations to protect personal data processed by mobile applications by:  Deploying risk mitigation practices  Implementing security in mobile application development cycles (privacy by design)  Having visibility on personal data flows and their level of security  Monitoring data processing activities
Financial data
The Payment Service Directive 2 (PSD2) is a European law dedicated to enforcing the security of mobile banking / payment applications, mobile wallets and all shopping apps that offer a payment functionality. It will be enforced in 2022 and requires developers to enable apps with:  A strong authentication mechanism  A mean to secure their execution environment
The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) requires all merchants that use mobile payments to protect cardholder data by maintaining a secure environment, by:  Protecting mobile devices against malicious programs  Auditing and fixing mobile application's vulnerabilities
Health data
Laws regulating the healthcare sector are mostly domestic, such as the HIPAA (USA), HSCIC (UK), CNIL (France), etc. Most of them share the same key guidelines and require to:  Regularly review information system activities  Implement solutions to detect and mitigate security incidents (including malicious software)  Alert in case of security incident

SECURING A MOBILE APPLICATION
To protect an application, every step of its lifecycle must be handled with a security perspective, from its development to operations: this is what is called a DevSecOps approach. Failing to secure one of the steps of an application's lifecycle endangers all the others and cancels the benefits of the security measures implemented.
The timeline below gathers the security needs of a mobile application through its life, combined with the services that meets them.
Pradeo's mobile application security platform supports teams' DevSecOps approach by centralizing various AppSec services to fully secure mobile applications from development to operations.

SECURING A MOBILE APPLICATION

1 Development Breach prevention

Audit your mobile application security
Before releasing a mobile application, organizations must ensure it does not embed any unwanted behavior or vulnerability that jeopardizes its privacy. Mobile Application Security Testing (MAST) solutions audit mobile apps for potential internal threats and conclude on their security level against a chosen security policy. Many MAST solutions are available on the market, making it difficult for security teams to make a comparison. Here are the key functionalities to aim for, associated to the needs they answer.
