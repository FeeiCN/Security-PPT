SOLUTION NOTE
Infoblox Ecosystem Exchange
Reducing Threat Response Time and Costs with Enhanced Productivity and Automation
SUMMARY Infoblox Ecosystem Exchange is a highly connected set of integrations that enable organizations to eliminate silos, optimize security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) solutions and improve the ROI of their entire cybersecurity ecosystem, including third-party, multi-vendor assets. It reduces the time it takes to respond to threats as well as the cost through enhanced automation and real-time, two-way data sharing enabled by extensive APIs.

Infoblox's extensive integrations enable the broader cybersecurity ecosystem to work in unison to detect and remediate threats (Figure 1). They combine aggregated, curated threat intelligence, more than 30 API-level vendor integrations and pervasive automation, enabling network and security teams to:

 Gain centralized visibility into devices and DNS- based threat vectors across onpremises, virtual and cloud deployments, including VMWare, AWS, Azure, Cisco ACI and OpenStack
 Orchestrate common security policy across the infrastructure
 Decrease time to remediation by up to two-thirds

 Reduce costs associated with manual intervention and human error
 Reduce the number of alerts teams must review
 Make threat analysts up to three times more productive
 Optimize SOAR solutions by automatically sharing contextual threat information

 Improve the effectiveness of threat intelligence across the ecosystem
 Lower cost of SIEM solutions by sending only suspicious DNS data to these platforms
 Get better ROI from existing network security investment

Ecosystem Technology

Integration Overview

Benefits

Advanced Threat Detection (FireEye NX Series)

 BloxOneTM Threat Defense automatically shares information with advanced threat detection solutions on incidents involving advanced persistent threat (APT) activity and malicious domains
 Infoblox then automatically blocks, logs events or takes appropriate action on these threats

 Enables flexible policy enforcement  Rapidly identifies infected devices  Builds defense and remediation into IT
systems and processes

Threat Intelligence Sharing (ThreatConnect, Cisco Threat Intelligence Director, Check Point Threat Cloud, Windows
Server 2016)

 Infoblox Threat Intelligence Data Exchange (TIDE) sends information on malicious host names, IP addresses and URLs to the threat intelligence platform (TIP)
 TIP enables blocking and monitoring of more threats

 Reduces the number of alerts that require review
 Improves situational awareness for network and security organizations
 Enhances overall security posture

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) (LogRhythm, Splunk, McAfee
ESM, IBM, QRadar, Micro Focus ArcSight)

 Infoblox sends information on IP addresses, infected devices and suspicious DNS requests and responses to SIEM
 SIEM can use this information to perform analysis and take action

Vulnerability Management (Qualys, Rapid7, Tenable Security Center)

 Infoblox sends information on IP addresses, network devices and malicious events to vulnerability management
 Vulnerability management uses that information to automatically trigger scans, enabling easier compliance and accelerated remediation

 Provides consolidated visibility into device activity regardless of where log data was generated
 Supplies context for more accurate prioritization of security events
 Improves operational efficiency of network ops and IT teams
 Provides near-real-time visibility into new devices as they join the network
 Automates and accelerates responses to network changes and malicious events
 Improves ROI on security investments already made

Network Access Control (NAC)
(Cisco, ISE, Aruba ClearPass, ForeScout)

 Infoblox provides information on IP addresses, network devices and DNS security events
 NAC solutions can use that information to get context to better prioritize threats and take more immediate action (such as removing a device from the network) to shorten time to containment

 Expands visibility into network infrastructure, users and devices
 Provides vital context for threat prioritization  Enables consistent policy enforcement

Next Generation End-point Security
(Carbon Black, McAfee ePO)

 Infoblox detects DNS-based malware

 Quickly identifies and prevents DNS-based

communications and informs next generation endpoint communications to malicious

endpoint security technologies

domains

 These products can identify the malicious processes, quarantine the endpoint or take other actions
 For added protection, endpoint security solutions can incorporate Infoblox client agents

 Automatically responds to endpoint threats, reducing dwell time
 Enables mass deployment of Infoblox endpoint agent for DNS security and streamlines workflows

Next Generation Firewall (NGFW)
(Palo Alto Networks)

 NGFW receives malicious host names, IP addresses and URLs from Infoblox TIDE
 NGFW enables customer to block or monitor threats

 Reduces the number of alerts to review  Improves situational awareness for
network and security organizations  Strengthens overall security posture

Web Gateway (McAfee)

 BloxOne Threat Defense blocks DNS-based data exfiltration, as well as DNS requests to malicious domains before forwarding the traffic to McAfee Web Gateway
 The web gateway then scans traffic for further inspection with URL filtering, SSL and more

 Unifies domain blocking and http security for broader protection
 Speeds detection of malicious traffic originating from infected endpoints, regardless of its location
 Complements web gateway with DNSbased threat intelligence

Security Orchestration, Automation and Response
(Phantom Cyber)

 SOAR solution receives information on IP address, network devices and malicious events from Infoblox
 SOAR uses that information to block/unblock/check domain, check information about IP/host/network/domain in IPAM
 Infoblox automatically enriches IPAM with data from security tools and events

 Integrates disparate security tools and provides vendor-neutral threat intelligence for all devices
 Automates and produces faster response with full set of threat intelligence APIs
 Enhances and improves incident response with better threat intelligence
 Improves security processes by integrating with other systems via SOAR

ITSM/ITOM/Security Operations (ServiceNow)

 Infoblox sends information on new devices, networks and IP addresses to ITSM/ITOM/ Security Operations
 Network and security admins can view devices and events discovered by Infoblox in a single place

 Provides at-a-glance dashboard views into devices and endpoints joining and leaving the network
 Enables proactive identification of network issues to accelerate responses to network changes and security events

Automating Workflows through Cloud Ecosystem Integration
Networks ops teams may have hundreds of network tools in their environment. Often, these tools work in silos, making it very difficult to see the full range of diverse network assets in a single place. Today's organizations also use varied deployments and architectures, from physical to virtual to cloud. Infoblox ecosystem integration enables networkers to gain a consolidated view of assets and architectures, while automating common workflows to speed response times and improve agility.

Infoblox network automation and cloud eocystem integrations enable organizations to:
 Unify domain blocking and http security for broader protection
 Speed detection of malicious traffic originating from infected endpoints, regardless of its location
 Complement web gateway with DNS-based threat intel
