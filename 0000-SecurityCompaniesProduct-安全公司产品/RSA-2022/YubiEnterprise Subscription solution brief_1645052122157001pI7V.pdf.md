YubiEnterprise Subscription
YubiEnterprise Subscription offers flexible purchasing options to easily buy and upgrade to the latest YubiKeys as your business evolves.

Enabling strong security while driving business acceleration
Organizations are looking for better and more efficient ways to improve security while making it easier for users to adopt best practices and enhancing productivity. With a single corporate security breach costing an average of $4.24M1, and with compromised credentials the most common initial attack vector2, a stronger approach such as hardware security keys based on modern authentication standards offers the gold standard in authentication. Enabling organizations to leverage flexible and cost-effective ways to procure strong authentication greatly heightens the security posture of the business.

YubiKey: Proven, easy-to-use security that's trusted by the world's leading companies

Prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and eliminate account takeovers
Any software downloaded on a computer or phone is vulnerable to malware and hackers. The YubiKey is based on hardware with the authentication secret stored on a separate secure chip built into the YubiKey, with no connection to the internet so it cannot be copied or stolen. Additionally, centralized servers with stored credentials can be breached. With the YubiKey, the data is encrypted with strong public key cryptography where only the public key is stored on the server, eliminating risks.
Reduces IT costs
The YubiKey dramatically reduces the number one IT support cost--password resets--which cost Microsoft over $12M per month.3
By switching from mobile one time passwords (OTPs) to YubiKeys, Google saw the following results.4
 Zero account takeovers
 4x faster logins
 92% fewer IT support calls

Easy to use, fast, and reliable
Users don't need to install anything and can use the YubiKey in minutes. And the YubiKey is reliable because it does not require a battery or network connectivity, so it's always on and accessible.
Easy to deploy
IT can deploy YubiKeys in days, not months. A single key, through its flexible multi-protocol capabilities, can work out-of-the-box with hundreds of systems, both cloud and on-premises. This eliminates the need for costly integrations or separate devices for each system, and can support passwordless, strong two-factor and multi-factor authentication scenarios.
Trusted authentication leader
Yubico is the principal inventor of the WebAuthn/FIDO2 and U2F authentication standards adopted by the FIDO alliance and is the first company to produce the U2F security key and a multiprotocol FIDO2 authenticator.
YubiKeys are produced in our offices in the USA and Sweden, maintaining security and quality control over the entire manufacturing process.
