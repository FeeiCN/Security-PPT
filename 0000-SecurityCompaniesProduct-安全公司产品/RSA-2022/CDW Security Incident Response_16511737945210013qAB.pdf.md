It's every IT leader's nightmare scenario: a major security incident, locking employees from files, corrupting data and potentially devastating the organization.

Orchestrating the Right Solution
CDW's IT Security Incident Response (IR) Services team provides assurance that your organization is aware of any security incident and is ready to respond to credential theft, malware outbreaks, security breach and other potential security incidents.
Organizations that seek outside help only after discovering a security breach often wait days or weeks for lawyers to negotiate contracts with service providers. When you decide to add CDW's Retainer-Based Security IR Services to your cybersecurity plan, that paperwork is handled up front, meaning there's no downtime between discovery and action.

Certifications
We have helped more than 75 clients with their security incidents, and more than 125 clients trust CDW's Retainer-based Security Incident Response Services. CDW has achieved the following certifications:

CLIENT SUCCESS STORY
Organization: Manufacturer
CHALLENGE: A 32-site manufacturing client headquartered in the Midwest had two malware incidents occurring simultaneously. Their anti-virus solution was ineffective in protecting their workstations and the methods the client had been using to contain and eradicate the malware was unsuccessful. In addition, the client had almost no budget for IT Security.
SOLUTION: The client contacted their CDW seller to initiate an on-demand Security Incident Resonse engagement and within 15 minutes CDW had a security IR consultant on the phone and a Security IR Consultant onsite quickly. The IR Consultant:
 Worked through the weekend with the client to contain the incident and stabilize their environment.
 Consulted with the client regarding breaking implied trust and deploying host-based firewalls.
 Worked with the client after their environment was stabilized on an ad hoc basis providing support and recommendations.
RESULT: CDW's quick response time helped the client stop the malware from doing any more damage. In addition, the valuable insight from CDW's IR Consultant enabled the client to reduce the chances of a similar incident recurring. CDW went from being their trusted security vendor to their trusted security partner, which enabled the client's IT department to influence their executives to invest in improving their security strategy.
