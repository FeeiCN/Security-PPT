Following are the key capabilities of In-App Protection solutions:
· Application Hardening: Application hardening protects applications from reverse engineering and tempering, secures apps, repacking, and more by leveraging code obfuscation, white-box cryptography, and other techniques. Application hardening includes active hardening and passive hardening to detect and respond to the use of debuggers by altering the application's behavior and making the application more resistant to attacks based on static analysis.
· Anti-Tempering: Anti-tampering monitors web and mobile application behavior and covers the overall runtime risk and attack spectrum in real-time. Anti-tempering allows users to secure intellectual property and protect applications from creating a false version, defacing, changing logic, and inserting workflows. Additionally, it alerts applications when risks are detected and secures against attempts to repackage and alter mobile apps.
· RASP (Run-time Application Self Protection): RSAP continuously analyses web or non-web app behavior and context of behavior to detect and protect from malicious input or behavior without any human involvement. RASP allows integration of security into a running program, regardless of where its location, intercepts all calls from the app to a system, and validates data requests immediately within the app. RASP works without impacting app design by operating on the server where the app is operating.
· Risk Assessment: In-App Protection analyses and identifies potential threat actors and sensitive data in applications, map the attack surface, scan, and remediate vulnerabilities, determine AppSec process pain points, and strategize the security roadmap to protect against application attacks in real-time.
· Authentication Support: In-App Protection enables automatic authentication of a user when they request to access privileged data and applications. In-App Protection uses multi-factor authentication (MFA) techniques and enhances security by eliminating risky password management practices.

These factors are driving enterprises of all sizes to shift towards APIs. However, enterprises do need an integrated set of application security capabilities along with effortless deployment of their APIs, which can be leveraged by In-App protection tools. In-app protection tools allow developers to integrate high-level security measures, such as implementing strong authentication techniques paired with limited rate of access, in their APIs to prevent hackers from harvesting data from API servers.
In-App Protection solution address the growing demands of dynamic regulatory environment
While selecting/adopting In-App Protection solutions, enterprises look for regulatory compliances such as PCI-DSS, HIPAA, NIS, GDPR, FISMA, ISO 27001, as these regulations help organizations upgrade security and prevent information theft or misuse and the consequent penalties and negative publicity. Global regulations are becoming more complex, and enterprises must focus on creating strong security infrastructure and implementing the best practices. According to the EU's GDPR, the enterprise must ensure that enterprise data is gathered legally and monitor and protect this data from misuse and exploitation. Failure to do so would result in a penalty therefore, organizations are required to account for all sensitive data and the access granted to it. Applications contain and process personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive data like credentials of the users, which can be phished from vulnerable mobile devices. In-App protection helps organizations to meet the stringent global compliance standards to avoid and prevent security breaches and strengthen compliances with global regulations.
Increased Adoption of Cloud-Based Resources and Applications

Zimperium MAPS offers sub-features to protect mobile app life cycle such as zScan, zKeyBox, zShield, and zDefend. Zimperium zScan enables developers to search and fix compliances, privacy, and security issues in the development phase. Zimperium zKeyBox secures cryptographic keys and prevents them from being detected, extracted, or manipulated. Zimperium zShield protects apps from reverse engineering, code tampering, privacy, extracting assets, extracting API keys, and malware injection with the help of obfuscation and anti-tampering functionality. Zimperium provides SDK zDefend to detect and protect against device, network, phishing, and malware attacks.
Zimperium zScan assists developers in automatically identifying privacy, security, and compliance concerns during the development process before the apps are released to the public. zScan's binary analysis detects vulnerabilities in the program that an attacker could exploit. Furthermore, zScan documents risks within mobile apps such as hardware-specific usage, insecure API calls, and sensitive data handling, allows apps to be scanned directly from the build pipeline or manually uploaded to the administrative console as desired and enables compliance and security teams to define and customize policies to ensure only the applicable findings are opened. Furthermore, zScan's "Build Compare" feature instantly identifies whether risks are trending up or down in each succeeding version. Organizations can use version comparisons to track compliance progress and create more robust mobile apps.

Zimperium zKeyBox uses white-box cryptography to safeguard keys, secrets, and standard or custom cryptographic algorithms on any platform within the mobile application. zKeyBox ensures that keys are never exposed, and the execution logic is untraceable. zKeyBox also modifies and obscures cryptographic algorithms without compromising keys even if the device has been compromised. Furthermore, Zimperium does not rely on hardware provided by the underlying platform to support regulatory compliance, provides great performance on a wide range of architecture, and a deep cryptographic experience to help the users through every stage of their application implementation.
Zimperium zShield protects the source code, intellectual property (IP), and data within the application from threat actors by hardening and protecting the app utilizing powerful obfuscation and anti-tampering capability. zShield guards against reverse engineering, Advanced Obfuscation, Anti-Debugging, Binary Packing, and Diversification. Additionally, zShield offers anti- tempering features, including Integrity Checking, Anti-Method Swizzling, Function Caller Verification, Jailbreak / Rooting Detection, Shared Library Cross-Checking, Mach-O Binary Signature Verification, Google Play Licensing Protection, and Customizable defense actions.
Zimperium's zDefend prevents on-device exploitation, assists enterprises in gaining runtime threat visibility, and allows mobile apps to defend themselves against mobile threats in real-time. Zimperium's patented machine-learning-based Mobile Threat Defense engine z9 is used in zDefend. As a software development kit, the solution may be easily integrated into any iOS or Android application (SDK). Furthermore, zDefend aids in comprehensive device protection by providing dynamic threat response, threat visibility, security ecosystem integrations such as SIEM, SOAR, and incident response, as well as flexible deployment models and simple implementation.
