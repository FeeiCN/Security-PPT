Cloud Migration
Elastic Applications and Security Services Validation

CyPerf

Keysight's CyPerf is the world's first agent-based test solution that recreates every aspect of a realistic workload across a variety of cloud environments to deliver insights into end user experience, security posture, and performance bottlenecks of public and private clouds. By first installing CyPerf test agents in cloud instances, users can send application mixes and cyberattacks across various topologies to optimize migration to the cloud.

Cloud Migration Challenges
 Struggling to rightsize cloud and optimize cost while minimizing user disruptions
 Testing efficacy of elastic environment is a challenge due to its dynamic nature
 Isolating bottlenecks in cloud environment with too many variables including instance types, different network infrastructure, third-party vendor devices, and rules
 Ensuring that the devices and technologies that are running fine on-premises works seamlessly in the cloud

Cloud migration's unique advantages and even more unique challenges

CyPerf--Your Solution to Seamless Cloud Migration

 Use CyPerf's attack emulation capability to validate security features in cloud like web application firewall (WAF) or next generation firewall (NGFW) and ensure they work similarly to their on-premises counterpart

 Install CyPerf agents in cloud to benchmark true application performance of cloud instances and topologies that may involve switching, natting, or going through internet gateways to another cloud location or on-premises

 Leverage CyPerf's ability to elastically scale up per the policies of the auto-scale group that it is part of to accurately measure the performance and security impact of elastic scale up or down
 Validate individual security controls and cloud services like NGFW, IDS, WAF, and ELB for performance, scale, and security effectiveness
