A PRACTICAL GUIDE
6 Steps to Efficiently and Confidently Manage Vulnerabilities by Focusing on Risk

A tidal wave of vulnerabilities

The traditional everything-is-at-risk approach to vulnerability management (VM) no longer works in a world where vulnerabilities proliferate and hacker sophistication is constantly expanding the threat landscape. The number of vulnerabilities observed in devices, networks and applications has grown dramatically in recent years. Figure 1 illustrates this rise by tracking the past decade's growth of Common Vulnerabilities and Exploits (CVEs) published in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).

Also on the rise: Highly sophisticated efforts to exploit those vulnerabilities. According to the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC), the number of recorded data breaches jumped 17% from 2018 to 2019. This trend shows no signs of slowing. In just the first two months of 2020, 1.66 billion records were exposed in 11,476 breaches.

It doesn't help that the typical enterprise is beset by millions of vulnerabilities, and even the most well-resourced organizations can only address 10% of them. While an even smaller percentage-- just 2% to 5%--are likely to emerge as legitimate threats to any enterprise environment, the traditional ways of managing vulnerabilities aren't likely to be much help in pinpointing those most likely to be weaponized. Vulnerability scanners offer IT and Security teams little insight into the specific risk that each vulnerability poses to an organization.

Key Definitions
RISK
The potential for loss, damage or destruction of assets or data as a result of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.
THREAT
A negative event, typically the exploit of a known vulnerability, that results in the loss, damage or exposure of an asset or data.
VULNERABILITY
A weakness within a device, application, network or other asset that makes a negative event possible or more significant.

The cost of pursuing an everything-is-a-risk approach
Old approaches to VM have failed to keep pace in a world where the number of annual published CVEs has tripled since 2016 and cyber criminals are more sophisticated and organized than ever. Many enterprises still rely on the habit of patching anything above a certain threshold, such as Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scores of seven or above. Some continue to use huge spreadsheets of vulnerabilities that they then sort based on intuition, the public profile of a vulnerability, or the number of assets affected. Unfortunately, these traditional approaches are not effective, much less efficient.

Over time, the impossible pressure to fix everything drives up costs, erodes the working relationship between IT, Security and DevOps, and leads to enormous and persistent waste of resources that could be put toward more strategic tasks.
Let's face it: Without insight into which vulnerabilities pose the greatest risk to your specific organization, there's no way to know if you're remediating the right ones. So instead of closing the vulnerabilities most likely to be exploited, Security teams remediate as many vulnerabilities as they can with the hope that they've closed the right ones.

Without a better approach to VM, Security teams often come to IT with lists of thousands of so-called "critical" vulnerabilities. IT teams then waste precious cycles patching vulnerabilities that may not present much of a risk to their organization, while ignoring others that do. This prevents them from putting more time into other, more strategic projects that support business objectives. Meanwhile, indiscriminate patching of business-critical applications can cause downtime and threaten SLAs, effectively increasing the risk of downtime.

Focus on what matters: Risk
This is why Security teams must shift their focus away from rudimentary or manual prioritization to concentrating on the vulnerabilities that matter most to their particular IT environment. A true riskbased vulnerability management (RBVM) approach aligns teams around identifying and remediating vulnerabilities that are most likely to be exploited. It provides much-needed clarity and insight to organizations wanting to make the most of their Security, IT and DevOps resources.

business. With a risk-based approach, remediation teams are able to focus their efforts on the most strategically impactful actions--say, the top three things they can do to significantly strengthen security. In addition, remediation teams can make more effective use of their time, as they no longer have to sift through giant reports or hunt down fixes.
Why is risk-based vulnerability management the future of VM?

When a focus on risk is incorporated into operations across the organization, the critical efforts that need to happen do happen, and everyone benefits:
1. Security Teams can start measuring real risk and understand how best to reduce it. By aligning around risk, organizations create a self-service environment so Security and IT automatically work toward the same goal. And by automating and prioritizing everyone's focus on the vulns that pose the greatest risk to the business, teams can devote more time to reporting, oversight, and exception handling.
2. Executive Teams gain a clear understanding of the company's security posture, including how it's changing, as well as the efforts and investments needed for continued improvement. Businesses ultimately profit from stronger security and improved productivity across a number of different business groups.
3. IT and DevOps can continue to work with existing tools, processes and platforms while gaining increased visibility into the risks facing the

Making it work: 6 steps to implementing RBVM
Implementing a risk-based approach to vulnerability management involves six key steps:
1. Identify the players

Vulnerability management is a team sport, and you'll need a roster of qualified people with the right skills. The makeup of your team will be unique to your organization, depending on the various skill sets your team members have and the resource constraints you face.
With luck, you already have a director or manager responsible for VM and an analyst or analysts who help identify, track, and assess vulnerabilities across all the assets in your organization--devices, networks, applications and more.
The job of the VM team is to understand the threat landscape by weighing relevant factors, such as:
· Does exploit code exist for the vulnerability? · What is the likelihood of this vulnerability being
exploited? · Is there evidence of it being exploited in the wild? · What is the impact on the business if the
vulnerability is exploited?
The remediation team usually involves more players than the VM team, simply because the responsibility of fixing vulnerabilities is typically distributed across the departments that own the various aspects of the larger

IT environment (See Figure 2). This makes it even more important for the Security team (working under the CISO) and IT team (under the CIO) to align around priorities and metrics so they can work efficiently and collaboratively.
For AppSec, fewer vulnerabilities but longer fix times
Finding and fixing vulnerabilities in the enterprise software stack is just as critical as they are for devices, networks, and other assets. For Application Security (AppSec) teams, there's good news: Generally, there are fewer vulnerabilities in your stack than in your infrastructure. But because they often require internal teams to come up with custom fixes, application vulnerabilities take longer to fix.
Development teams (or DevOps teams, depending on your organization) are primarily focused on developing applications, especially those that impact the bottom line. So it's vitally important that they also be laser focused only on remediating those vulnerabilities that represent the most application risk. To do that, make sure your AppSec team is able to determine whether an application vulnerability:

those with sensitive data) 3. Occurs prior to login 4. Affects important apps that don't require login
In all cases, by identifying the roles and responsibilities of each member of the larger team involved in VM, you'll lay the groundwork for success.

2. Put the right tools in place

For the vast majority of organizations, the days of struggling to manage vulnerabilities on spreadsheets are long gone.

Modern cyberthreats move quickly and constantly, and you need modern tools to keep up. Here's a quick summary of tools that every enterprise should consider.
Tools for finding vulnerabilities
Vulnerability scanners. You want to start with scanning your infrastructure assets to uncover known weaknesses. You may choose to run the scanner on premises or opt for a software-as-a-service solution. Either way, you need at least one vulnerability scanner that can scale to your enterprise. Though all scanners perform essentially the same function, some organizations choose to run more than one scanner as a cross-check in case one misses a vulnerability that the other vendor's scanner could catch.
Application security tools. An application security tool set generally starts with static application security testing (SAST) to analyze applications at the code level for vulnerabilities. SAST tools are an essential part of any AppSec program. But because SAST is notoriously slow and known for false positives, many development organizations perform dynamic application security testing (DAST), which scans a running application. We advocate using both, though interactive application security testing (IAST), a relative newcomer, may be an

interesting additional security tool. This tool sits inline with the application, watches traffic, and identifies vulnerabilities. IAST has fewer false positives and more false negatives than SAST, but is also harder to set up.
Pen (penetration) testing tools. Pen testing is standard practice in most development organizations. It is an effective way to uncover application vulnerabilities that other security tools may have missed, especially because it simulates a real-world cyberattack performed by professionals.
Bug bounty programs. A bug bounty program compensates individuals for finding bugs and reporting them to the organization. The idea is to uncover vulnerabilities before they become known to the general public, where they would run a much greater risk of being exploited. Many bug hunters uncover vulnerabilities that can't easily be found using automated tools.
Software composition analysis (SCA) tools. Given the widespread use of open source software, you will also want to include SCA in your AppSec toolbox. An SCA tool breaks down open source into its prime components, identifies each component in use, and then runs a check of each component against a database of known vulnerabilities.

PRO TIP:
Do you run containers? Many traditional asset scanners aren't optimized to scan containers--for that you may need a specific container scanner. The good news: Some of the leading asset vulnerability scanner vendors now also offer support that is optimized for scanning containers.

PRO TIP:
Real-time threat and exploit feeds are essential to understanding what is currently being exploited, and to what degree. That intel gives Security the insight it needs to factor attacker behavior into their prioritization. In addition to feeds, look to threat exchanges and online chatter. The most advanced RBVM solutions incorporate data from an extensive array of sources to deliver a comprehensive picture of external threats.

Asset awareness
Once you understand where the vulnerabilities are, you'll need to know what to do with them. That requires a comprehensive understanding of the assets those vulnerabilities could affect, and what those assets mean to your business.
For this, a configuration management database (CMDB) is a useful resource. A CMDB provides detailed information about all the hardware and software assets in your organization, such as configuration, ownership, network security zone, etc. It's crucial for determining how critical an asset vulnerability is based on where it fits in the business and its relationship with other assets.
Vulnerability management solution
Now that you have the data, you'll need to make sense of it. This is where you'll want a risk-based vulnerability management solution that correlates and centralizes all of that data, and then tells you which vulnerabilities pose the greatest risk to you. This way you'll know which vulnerabilities to fix first and which ones can wait.
You'll then want to feed this information into your remediation workflow so everyone is aligned around risk and can remediate with confidence. This is typically achieved by using a ticketing system to send tickets to IT, then track the remediation process through to completion.

At this point, you should disseminate the intelligence that Security has gathered on the vulnerability to IT and DevOps, so they'll understand what to fix, how to fix it, and why it's a priority. This will not only facilitate better teamwork and collaboration between the two groups, but will save the remediation teams the hours of time they used to spend re-investigating and validating the vulnerability, searching for the solution, and more. Once the ticket is closed, rescan to ensure the vulnerability is truly resolved.
PRO TIP: A risk scoring
system is perhaps the best way to communicate risk in ways that everyone can understand and act upon. Look for RBVM solutions that provide risk scoring across multiple asset and functional groups.
Because the threat landscape is bound to only grow more complex, we recommend evaluating only those RBVM solutions that centralize internal and external data to provide a comprehensive picture of your overall risk.

3. Determine where you intersect with the threat landscape

In Step 2, you itemized the tools that will help you find and manage your vulnerabilities. Now comes another step that's essential for determining which threats pose the greatest risk to your unique environment.
Here, you want to understand what attackers are doing. Sometimes, a vulnerability that exists in many types of organizations may only be applicable in financial services or healthcare organizations. So if you're a food distributor, that vulnerability may not pose as large a risk to you as it might to them.
Now take your understanding of your assets and known vulnerabilities in your organization and crossreference them with your threat intelligence. This will help you determine the impact of a potential exploit-- another key factor in determining risk. As discussed in step 2, you have data from your vulnerability scanners and CMDB. But this information is often only part of the story. To get a complete picture of how important your assets are, you should pull in data from your identity and access management (IAM) infrastructure, have discussions with your finance people, and understand which teams are plugging into public clouds. This is one of the big challenges for proper VM: There are so many sources.
To get started cross-referencing the threat landscape with the knowledge you have of your assets and vulnerabilities, you can use tools such as these

developed by MITRE: CVE lists, CPE (common platform enumeration) and CWE (common weakness enumeration) information. You can also use ATT&CK, which provides a taxonomy around attacker behavior. This is useful to cross-reference what is possible on an asset with what is actually happening in the broader threat landscape.
An RBVM solution should be capable of doing all of these things within a single, centralized environment.
Why prioritization is so critical
Of the more than 110,000 published CVEs, just over one fifth of them have known exploits, according to Prioritization to Prediction Vol. 2: Getting Real About Remediation. And fewer than 2 percent of those CVEs are ever exploited in the wild. So it only makes sense to focus your remediation efforts on those vulnerabilities most likely to be exploited, rather than expending resources on all the others.
But that's not the whole story. Some so-called "high priority" vulnerabilities known to be exploited in the wild may only exist in your environment on a noncritical system. So that particular vulnerability likely poses a relatively low risk to your business. In that case, is it worth the effort to fix it?

How much of a risk is this vuln, anyway?
Properly prioritizing vulnerabilities based on risk involves many considerations, but these four are a great start:

1

Is the vulnerability generally useful to attackers? If you have a vulnerability that allows an

attacker to execute malicious code remotely, they

can utilize a variety of different payloads, making

the vulnerability something that's useful in many

contexts.

2

Does the vulnerability have a weaponized or published exploit? Attackers can use pen testing

tools such as Metasploit and the Exploit Database

both to find--and exploit--weaknesses in your

organization's defenses. This means a vulnerability

identified with a Metasploit module or identified

in the Exploit Database should be a top priority for

remediation. And note that blackhat exploit kits are

almost always used for malicious intent, so they're

automatically contenders for priority remediation.

3

Is the vulnerability widely prevalent? Attackers can be lazy. If given the opportunity to use a

known (and well-tested) exploit, they will. Vulnera-

bilities that are extremely prevalent (Java, Office, or

Adobe Acrobat) are favorites.

4

Is the vulnerability seeing active exploitation? Check your threat feeds, or your RBVM

platform's internal database, to see if there is an

active exploit for your vulnerability.

4. Understand your assets, applications, and tolerance for risk

If you want to truly know your risk, you have to know your assets and applications.

Getting to those details is an essential part of how you will implement RBVM. You need a complete and detailed asset inventory to realize the full value of a CMDB, the database of your hardware and software assets mentioned earlier.
This assessment can get pretty involved, so it helps to break it into three questions.
1. What assets do you have? Rely on automated tools to help with this discovery task, which will scan your organization to identify assets like servers, workstations, virtual machines, storage arrays, and network devices. You can also use an automated discovery process to understand your DNS and WHOIS records, identify IP address ranges and domains you own, as well as the ports, applications and services running on your assets. Then look closely at the applications you're running. If your team built a web application, understand the risk presented by that source code or open source libraries--along with the infrastructure that supports the application. The more information you have about your assets and applications, the more specific you can be when defining your risk tolerance levels.

2. How much risk will your business tolerate? Different businesses look at risk differently. Heavily regulated businesses (financial services, for instance, or healthcare) are known for being more risk-averse than others. Look for sources within your company to point you to risk assessment guidelines involving other aspects of the business; these may help you understand how your company approaches risk. Does your business have a risk manager? If so, contact and collaborate with that person.
3. What's the level of risk that we can accept for a specific vuln? Some vulnerabilities are easily identified as priorities: They're known to be exploited by threats that target your industry, and they exist on mission-critical or customer-facing assets or applications. But another vulnerability might hold less risk overall, and is worth waiting for the next patch round. For all vulnerabilities, it's critical to understand how much risk you can accept and the trade-offs that come with either remediating now or waiting.
Insist on solutions that will help you measure the effectiveness of remediation in terms of risk reduction in a tangible and quantifiable way.

PRO TIP:
In assessing risk, consider:
· System susceptibility: value to attackers and vulnerabilities
· Threat accessibility: access points and attack surface
· Threat capability: tools, resources, and techniques

5. Measure and evaluate

Now that you have an awareness of your vulnerabilities, the threat landscape, and your relative tolerance to risk, you need a way to pull all that data together, measure and evaluate it, and come up with a prioritized list of vulnerabilities for remediation based, of course, on risk.
At this point, your choice of vulnerability management platform plays an essential role in the success of your RBVM program. When evaluating your options, consider these characteristics--and how well, or even if, the platforms you're considering feature them.
Data Science. Billions of data points must be correlated to provide the context necessary to determine the specific level of risk for each asset/application. This is no task for humans, even a team of highly skilled analysts. It requires leveraging modern technology, including automation and machine learning. Insist on it.

The use of risk as a metric. It's not enough just to prioritize vulnerabilities by relative risk; as vulnerability management gives way to risk-based vulnerability management, simple prioritization has become table stakes. For RBVM to become part of your risk reduction culture, you'll need a metric that takes into account how prevalent the vulnerability is in your environment, the potential severity an exploit would represent, and external threat intel that could indicate the likeliness of an exploit. The best RBVM platforms combine all this into a metric--or score--that is simple, understandable, and repeatable. (See Figure 3.)

Automated risk analysis. You could hire a fleet of data scientists to create the algorithms necessary to prioritize vulnerabilities based on risk. But few organizations have the time or resources to do that. So an RBVM platform is the logical choice. Look for solutions that feature advanced data science algorithms already proven to be effective in evaluating and predicting risk. The most advanced will employ techniques from information retrieval, epidemiology, financial portfolios, and machine learning to result in superior predictive capabilities, along with insights that can be understood by stakeholders throughout the business.

Figure 3: Examples of the Kenna Risk Score
For an effective RBVM program, you should insist on only those platforms that can meet or exceed these characteristics. Because in vulnerability management, "good enough" will never be good enough. You should expect the latest, most sophisticated capabilities from the vulnerability management platform you've entrusted your business to.

PRO TIP:
Deploy advanced data science to push your program to the next level and stay ahead of constantly moving threats. When evaluating RBVM programs, look for features like:
· Natural language processing. Investigates social media sites, the dark web, and other places where vulnerabilities are discussed, then extracts language associated with vulnerabilities for more complete risk assessments.
· Predictive modeling. Calculates the risk of vulnerability as soon as it is revealed--even before an exploit can be built.

6. Communicate, remediate, and report

Here's where all the work you've done up to this point comes together. It's the final, and most visible, step in managing the right level of risk for your business.
Communicating between Security, IT, and DevOps
The success of your program will rely heavily on Security communicating and collaborating efficiently and effectively with remediation teams from IT and DevOps. Your RBVM solution should give you the tools to do this.
· Look for integrations with ticketing systems. One-off ticketing for vulnerability remediation is time-consuming and wasteful. Tight integration between an RBVM program and your IT ticketing system like ServiceNow helps automate this process and shortens time to remediation.
· Give stakeholders their own risk metrics. Use dashboards to give owners of assets (or groups of assets) a real-time view into their relative risk level and how it's improved over time. Some solutions also provide useful context and mitigation instructions.

Determining remediation measures
Most organizations employ a mix of three common remediation tactics. Details will vary based on the nature of your own threat landscape, attack surface, and tolerance to risk.
· Automated patches. Automatic updates to popular platforms. Think Google Chrome's automatic updates. This is baseline protection.
· Patch management tools. A variety of tools are available to help you manage patches. Microsoft shops likely will build their process around Microsoft's "Patch Tuesday" release of patches to known vulnerabilities. Regularly maintained, these tools help keep entire classes of assets up to date.
· Manual updates. Complex and time-consuming, manual updates are sometimes necessary but also can involve a series of cascading dependencies and considerations.

The bottom line: Your RBVM solution should help--not hinder--communication and collaboration.

The power of riskbased SLAs:
Not all Service Level Agreements SLAs are created equal. A 2019 analysis of how Security and IT organizations are implementing SLAs uncovered the "motivating power of deadlines." In fact, defined SLAs helped reduce the volume of surviving (or not remediated) highrisk vulnerabilities by 15%.
Taking a risk-based approach to SLAs further enhances the power of these deadlines. Rather than arbitrarily setting SLA terms at 30, 60 or 90 days, Security teams can set SLAs based on real-world threat and exploit data, along with peer usage data. The result is a more meaningful approach to managing risk, and a more efficient focus on remediation..
While organizations can certainly design and implement their own riskbased SLAs, the most advanced VM solutions offer this capability today.

PRO TIP:
When communicating your progress to C-level execs and the board, leave the technical jargon behind. They all care about risk, so speak to that and its impact on the business and its finances. Tell a compelling story about risk, resources, and trade-offs. Anticipate questions about how your risk reduction compares to industry peers.

Establishing remediation deadlines
Setting deadlines for remediation is another crucial way to keep all stakeholders aligned around understandable and measurable goals. Security teams establish these deadlines, or Service Level Agreements (SLAs), based on factors like the severity of the vulnerability, asset criticality, and organizational risk tolerance. Our research has found that about twothirds of all organizations set SLAs for remediation.

You need a clear and accurate way of assessing your performance, which can be broken down into four key areas:
· Coverage - Measures the completeness of remediation efforts. What percentage of exploited or high-risk vulnerabilities were actually remediated?
· Efficiency ­ Measures the precision of remediation efforts. What percentage of vulnerabilities remediated were actually high risk?

Reporting on risks

· Velocity ­ Measures how long the remediation process takes.

Get started with RBVM
With vulnerabilities and exploits mounting, with traditional approaches to VM persistently falling short, with expectations for maintaining a secure and low-risk business environment escalating, has there ever been a better time to implement a risk-based vulnerability management program? The answer is obvious--not just to the organizations already managing vulnerabilities based on risk, but to leading analysts as well.
The future of vulnerability management will be risk-based.
