BitSight Assessment Reporting
Drive Efficiency & Automation Across Your ThirdParty Risk Assessment Process
Assessments are an integral component and serve as the foundation of most third-party risk management programs. The insights gained from these assessments serve as a tool to understand vendor security controls and procedures and to comply with both internal and regulatory third-party risk requirements. However, the process for completing these assessments is resource intensive, point-in-time, and lacks automation.
BITSIGHT ASSESSMENT REPORTING To drive efficiency throughout the assessment process, BitSight Assessment Reporting enables customers to gain the visibility required to validate assessment responses, focus limited resources on follow-up actions which lead to impactful risk reduction, and reduce the time it takes to complete a vendor assessment, especially during the onboarding process. With BitSight Assessment Reporting, customers can view their assessment directly in the BitSight platform with relevant BitSight risk data mapped alongside key assessment criteria and/or questions across any monitored vendor. In addition, customers can filter or search to view questions mapped to a specific risk vector. BitSight provides context for mapping risk data to specific criteria or questions so customers can collaborate with vendors to understand issues and remediate them.
