Key Management Enterprise Server
Enterprise-Class Key & Certificate Management Platform
Lifecycle Management, Robust User Permissions, and Full Automation Capabilities
The Key Management Enterprise Server (KMES) Series 3 is a scalable, versatile, and secure solution for managing large volumes of keys, certificates, and other cryptographic objects. Built around Futurex's proven cryptographic technology, the KMES's modular system architecture provides a custom solution to fulfill the unique needs of organizations across a wide range of industries. Full integration with Futurex's Hardened Enterprise Security Platform enables the KMES to offer unparalleled functionality expansion options alongside management of the entire Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for the platform.

The KMES' key and certificate lifecycle management capabilities enable organizations to establish a secure PKI without foregoing manageability. A single-device PKI platform, it doubles as a certificate authority (CA) and registration authority (RA), as well as offering a wide range of expansion capabilities.

Enterprise Automation Capabilities
As an enterprise-class product, the KMES's has the ability to manage very large quantities of keys, certificates, and other such objects, and sensible automation means the process is unencumbered.
Define automatic expiration rules, for example, to remove and replace keys of all major types, algorithms, and protocols on a user-defined schedule, without need of travel to the data center. Meanwhile organizations can set automatic alerts, so they're always informed about the status of their key and certificate infrastructure.
