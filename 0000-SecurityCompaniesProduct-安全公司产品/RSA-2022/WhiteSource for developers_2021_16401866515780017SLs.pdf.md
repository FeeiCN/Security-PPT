Security Tools for Developers

WhiteSource enables developers to code faster and more securely by focusing on automation, remediation, and prevention.
Integrating into developer environments (browsers, IDEs, and repositories), WhiteSource meets developers where they are, providing developers with the information they need -- when they need it, through frictionless integration.
WhiteSource for developers alerts on vulnerable or suspected components from the earliest stages of development, helping developers choose better components, detect vulnerabilities pre-build, and automate the prioritization and remediation process.

Supporting Developers in Their Native Environments
 Security designed to fit seamlessly into development processes,
to help minimize interruptions and friction between teams.
 WhiteSource integrates with top IDEs, repos, CI/CD tools, and bug trackers to help automate developer workflows,
leading with prevention and remediation to address security risks.
Freeing Developers From Security Tasks  Bridge security knowledge gaps and eliminate manual errors with Auto-remediation.  Get actionable insights you can trust won't break the build with dependency updates based on crowd intelligence.  Eliminate noise with dependency trace analysis that filters out up to 85% of security alerts.  Identify vulnerable open source components before they even enter the code with a browser integration tool that helps
you choose secure versions.
Proactively Securing the Supply Chain
 Comprehensive protection from supply chain attacks, from threat assessment
to proactive risk mitigation.
 WhiteSource Diffend runs automatically in the background. Invisible until needed, it blocks malicious files when necessary.
