SECURITY OBSERVABILITY FOR PRODUCTIVITY AND SERVER ENDPOINTS

INTRODUCTION
Uptycs provides you with unprecedented visibility across your endpoint fleet for threat detection and response, asset inventory and insight, audit and compliance, and more. Uptycs helps you protect all of your productivity and server endpoints.
SECURITY OBSERVABILITY AT SCALE
The Uptycs platform is built for large-scale collection and analysis of security telemetry, with a SaaS backend that applies Lambda streaming analytics to billions of points of telemetry each day gathered from our lightweight agents and collectors. Within seconds of an event, Uptycs correlates it with other signals and fires a single, high-quality detection. In addition, Uptycs automatically gathers relevant artifacts (files, socket connections, etc.) and generates pivot queries for investigation. After the real-time analysis, telemetry is stored for historical baselines, reports, and queries.
BEST-IN-CLASS EDR FOR ALL PLATFORMS
As remote working has become the norm, securing employees' laptops and workstations is more important than ever. Uptycs detects and correlates observed MITRE ATT&CK behaviors across macOS, Windows, and Linux endpoints (including for those running Graviton processors). Uptycs offers advanced EDR capabilities including file integrity monitoring, the ability to run YARA rules against live memory and files, file and process memory carving to extract malicious payloads, application allowlisting, and binary authorization and blocking.

Uptycs provides excellent coverage for the MITRE ATT&CK framework with hundreds of behavioral rules describing tactics and techniques for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

GO BEYOND THE ENDPOINT WITH XDR SCENARIOS
Uptycs also extends the types of detection scenarios possible, correlating endpoint telemetry with telemetry from other relevant data sources, such as cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes systems, SaaS applications, and identity providers. This type of extended detection and response (XDR) capability is increasingly important as your attack surfaces multiply.
PROACTIVELY HARDEN YOUR ENDPOINT ATTACK SURFACES
Uptycs provides much more than traditional EDR. Security, compliance, and IT operations teams also rely on Uptycs to proactively identify and remediate risk through:  Asset insight and inventory  Detection of vulnerable software packages  Robust support for audit and compliance

Uptycs supports a number of compliance standards including CIS Benchmarks, HIPAA, ISO, NIST, PCI, SOC 2, and STIG.
REMEDIATION AND BLOCKING
The Uptycs Protect add-on gives users the ability to safely remediate and block malicious or non-compliant activity on the endpoint. CSIRT teams and incident responders can take action when they observe real-time attack activity, and security teams can remediate issues without having to wait for IT Operations.

WHY UPTYCS
 Agent performance: Uptycs has made a number of improvements to the osquery agent, resulting in significantly better performance and stability. The agent typically consumes less than 4% CPU.
 Scalable: The Uptycs solution has been proven in large enterprise environments, operating safely in fleets of more than 300,000 servers in a single deployment.
 Platform support: Uptycs supports macOS, Windows, and a broad selection of Linux distributions, including those running on AWS EC2 Graviton instances.
 Flexible: Uptycs is highly extensible, allowing your to meet unique organizational needs with custom detections, monitoring policies, dashboards, etc.
 Integration: Uptycs offers a robust API that enables you to make the most of the solution, integrating with your existing security infrastructure (SIEM, SOAR, CMDB, etc).

Uptycs supports managed container deployments in the cloud such as ECS, EKS, and GKE.
"After a thorough evaluation by our security engineering team, Uptycs was deployed on a large scale
as a key component of our security posture. The Uptycs platform provides a broad set of security capabilities with instant endpoint and asset visibility that powers detection and response as well as compliance and governance.
