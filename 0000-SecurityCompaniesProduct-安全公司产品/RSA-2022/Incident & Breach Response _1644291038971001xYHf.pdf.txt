DATASHEET
OneTrust Incident & Breach Response
STREAMLINE BREACH INVESTIGATION & IMPROVE INCIDENT VISIBILITY
Incident Response and Notification is a Global Challenge
Breach notification laws are unique in their incident reporting requirements and continue to reduce the time organizations have to notify authorities of a breach. In some cases, this window is as little as 72 hours. Lastly, incidents lack documentation, involve more data, and occur more frequently. Without automation and knowledge of global breach notification law, compliance and response becomes a growing challenge.
