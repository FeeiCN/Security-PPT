CyGlass Network Defense as a Service
EMPOWER YOUR FIREWALL WITH AI RISK AND THREAT DETECTION

Adding CyGlass Network Defense as a Service to your on-premise or cloud firewall transforms this critical border guard into an AI driven risk and threat detection and remediation machine. The CyGlass NDaaS firewall addon connects in under 30 minutes, requires no on-premise hardware, and costs as low as $4.99 per user per month.
Together, your firewall plus CyGlass NDaaS allows your IT team to see risks across your network, detect cyberattacks like ransomware, and automatically remediate attacks 24X7 without the need for a SIEM.
CyGlass NDaaS utilizes advanced AI combined with a security policy engine to reduce the alerts and false positives down to a truly manageable amount of smart alerts. On average, a 30,000 user deployment will see 3 smart alerts per day.
See Risk Across Your Network
Network operations managers gain visibility to abnormal risky network activities including rogue devices, unprotected devices, threats to IoT devices and backup system failures without overburdening your IT team.
Detect Threats
CyGlass NDaaS enables automated continuous monitoring for threats across networks, cloud, and VPNs. Utilizing a unique combination of artificial intelligence, cyber TTP policies, and threat intelligence, CyGlass delivers a short, prioritized list of critical alerts, network risk scorecards with goals and objectives, and threat reports for cyber threats including ransomware.

Firewall + NDaaS = Enhance Visibility

For most companies, firewalls and endpoint protection remain critical components of their cybersecurity defenses. But, as cyber attackers have become more sophisticated, these tools have lost effectiveness. Modern ransomware attacks, for example, often bypass firewall and endpoint tools. At the same time, AI based network monitoring and threat detection has only been deployed in larger organizations. Costly and complex, AI based NDR tools are rarely deployed by medium and small organizations leaving these companies vulnerable to attack.
CyGlass NDaaS plugs into your firewall in less than 30 minutes, creating a powerful, SaaS network defense and monitoring solution in just minutes.

CyGlass NDaaS Delivery Architecture
CyGlass collects NetFlow, Syslog, and other logs via a data collector layer which ingests data, parses it into relevant formats, and transmits it to the AI engine via a secure SSH channel.
The CyGlass AI engine utilizes unsupervised machine learning in a big data architecture with integrated policy engine. The policy engine enables the fast deployment of operational, threat, and compliance objectives and controls which drive the relevant analytics.
Outputs include data flows to security tools, smart alerts, reporting, and an investigative UI.
