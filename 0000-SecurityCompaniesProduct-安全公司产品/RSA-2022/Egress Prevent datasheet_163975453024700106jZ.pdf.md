Egress Prevent
Stop accidental and intentional email data breaches before they happen.

The nature of email security has changed. Today's digitally connected world and a 24/7/365 working culture means time-pressured employees are making more mistakes and putting sensitive data at risk. Emails to the wrong recipient(s) or containing the wrong content and attachments, phishing victims, and malicious exfiltration are just some of the humanactivated threats that cause the majority of security breaches. We use contextual machine learning and advanced DLP to spot when employees are about to accidentally or intentionally leak data, empowering organizations to:
Prevent email data breaches
Send the right information to the right recipient(s), including personal data.
Enhance business efficiency
Prevent mistakes on the go with full mobile and OWA support.

Comply with global data privacy regulations
Ensure employees' use of email is compliant with regulations like CCPA, GDPR, and PDPA.
Minimize human error
Avoid user fatigue with seamless interaction and user experience.

Using contextual machine learning to account for real-world risks
Employees' behavior is unpredictable, meaning traditional, static approaches to data loss prevention (DLP) are unable to dynamically prevent breaches. Instead, we use contextual machine learning to inspect and continuously learn from a sender's behavior - including who they're emailing, when, and with what content - so we can detect abnormal behavior and prevent breaches of security before they happen. Our intelligent approach also minimizes employee interruptions, so they're not frustrated with an avalanche of prompts.

Quantifying risk for measurable compliance
We provide administrators with quick, on-demand reporting that tracks sensitive data and pinpoints any threats to regulatory compliance. Our granular insights ensure you can detect at-risk employees who require frequent help with misdirected emails or might be attempting to intentionally exfiltrate sensitive information.
In addition, our interactive timeline highlights where you have reduced instances of insecure data sharing to potentially unknown systems, improving compliance posture and demonstrating tangible ROI.
Detecting abnormal behavior
We use contextual machine learning to spot abnormal behaviour that puts data at risk and apply dynamic protection by analyzing four key areas:
