PRODUCT BRIEF
Link-VirtualizationTM Software for Programmable SmartNICs and IPUs

Maximize ROI for Cloud and Edge Data Centers Within Cloud and Edge data centers, the efficient utilization of server compute resources is key to maximizing overall ROI and energy efficiency. In virtualized environments, infrastructure handling consumes a significant portion of compute resources. Operators need to minimize the compute resources and energy used by infrastructure virtual switching and release these back to applications and services generating revenue.
Increase Virtual Machine Density Using Napatech Link-VirtualizationTM powered by an FPGA-based SmartNIC, infrastructure virtual switching is fully offloaded, enabling Cloud and Edge operators to increase VM density on the same COTS hardware. Link-Virtualization consumes just a single core for infrastructure handling, provides Open Standards-based support and enables Live Migration for fully transparent migration of VNFs between servers to solve shifting tasks as demand changes over time.
Full Open vSwitch (OVS) Offload Using the standard OVS-DPDK distribution, Link-Virtualization software adds powerful hardware acceleration to the virtual switch and megaflow caching - ensuring that only new and unknown flows are resolved in the host CPU. Offloading the virtual switch to the SmartNIC has several benefits, including:
 freeing up valuable CPU cycles for your critical applications rather than wasting cycles on infrastructure
 providing deterministic latency and jitter - regardless of packet size and number of flows
 increasing throughput
Furthermore, virtio-net (as opposed to SR-IOV) enables Live Migration of VNFs without being tied to the SmartNIC hardware. In other words, Link-Virtualization provides hardware offload of software equivalent switching - without imposing any restrictions on the system.

Napatech Link-Virtualization software is a production-grade, turnkey solution that harnesses the capabilities pioneered by hyperscale cloud service providers, and makes them readily available to cloud, 5G telecom, and enterprise data center networks of every size.
Bare Metal for Cloud Service Providers Link-Virtualization can also serve as bare-metal offload SmartNIC with full SDN support - exposing 16 virtio-net and 16 virtio-blk to the host and with full tenant isolation. Cloud Service Providers can deploy Link-Virtualization to offer its customers access to bare-metal servers, while retaining full SDN capabilities of the infrastructure.
Virtual Machine monitoring Napatech's VM-to-VM monitoring solution provides insight into both N-S and E-W traffic, where packets can be mirrored for analytics, SLA monitoring or regulatory purposes.
