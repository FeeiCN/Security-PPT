The Complete Cloud Native Security Platform
Unleash the full potential of your cloud native transformation and accelerate innovation with the confidence that your cloud native applications are secured from start to finish, at any scale. Aqua Platform protects your entire stack, on any cloud, across VMs, containers, and serverless.

Secure the
Build
Secure the
Infrastructure
Secure the
Workloads

Accelerate development by detecting security issues in your artifacts early and shortening time to remediate.
"Shift left" security into the CI/CD pipeline, get full visibility into the security posture of your pipeline and reduce the application attack surface before application deployment.
Enforce compliance across the stack, gain real-time visibility and control over your security posture.
Monitor, detect, and automatically remediate configuration issues across public cloud services and Kubernetes clusters. Ensure conformity with CIS benchmarks, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR and other regulations.
Protect applications in runtime using a zero trust model, with granular controls that accurately detect and stop attacks.
Unify security across VMs, containers, and serverless on any cloud, orchestrator, and operating system. Leverage micro-services concepts to enforce immutability and micro-segmentation.

Aqua's full lifecycle security approach provides coverage for all clouds and platforms, integrating with your existing infrastructure and the cloud native ecosystem.

Aqua Cloud Native Security Platform Key Features

Cloud Native Posture Management (CSPM)
 Continuously audit cloud accounts and services for security risks and misconfigurations
 Get actionable remediation advice, auto-remediate selected service settings
 Scan infrastructure-as-code templates (Terraform, AWS CloudFormation) for security issues
 Achieve consistent security across AWS, Azure, Google and Oracle cloud
Vulnerability Scanning
 Scan CI pipelines and registries, container images, VM images, and functions
 Find known vulnerabilities, malware, embedded secrets, OSS licensing, configuration, and permissions issues
 Filter and prioritize vulnerabilities based on risk factors such as exploitability, remote access, and running workloads
Dynamic Threat Analysis
 Detect and mitigate hidden malware in container images using a secure sandbox
 Thwart supply chain attacks before images are deployed in production
Container Security
 Use scan results to set policies for image deployment and prevent the use of unapproved images
 Mitigate known vulnerabilities with Aqua vShield, preventing exploits with no code changes
 Enforce container immutability by preventing drift against their originating images
 Use machine-learned behavioral profiles to narrow down capaiblities including syscalls
 Securely inject secrets into containers with no downtime while leveraging your existing vaults
 Protect Linux and Windows containers, TAS (PCF) containers, and CaaS (AWS Fargate, ACI)
Kubernetes Security
 Get real-time discovery and visualization of risks across your Kubernetes clusters
 Kubernetes Security Posture Management (KSPM) ensures ongoing secure configuration with built-in CIS benchmarks, least privilege RBAC, pen-testing, and pod deployment policies
 Secure Red Hat OpenShift, TKGI, Rancher, Amazon EKS, Azure AKS, Google GKE, and more

Cloud VM Security
 Use vulnerability and malware scan results to set policies for VM compliance
 Continuously use File Integrity Monitoring (FIM), system and registry integrity, and user activity
 Protect both Linux and Windows-based cloud instances
Serverless Security
 Use vulnerability and permission scan results to set policies for function compliance
 Track usage patterns for unused permissions and runtime anomalies
 Protect AWS Lambda functions at runtime, prevent code injections and use honeypots to detect indications of compromise
Identity-Based Segmentation
 Establish zero-trust networking between workloads of the same application identity
 Discover network connections across containers, VMs, and functions to create rules
 Firewall connections seamlessly within and across Kubernetes clusters and cloud providers
Regulatory Compliance
 Automate CIS benchmark tests for Cloud Fundamentals, Linux, Kubernetes, and Docker
 Out-of-the-box policies for PCI-DSS, HIPAA, NIST, and GDPR  Maintain history of scan results, policy changes, secrets rotation,
runtime events, user logins
Multi-Application RBAC
 Maintain separation of duties across teams and applications  Grant least privilege permissions by role to specific cloud native
artifacts, assets, and workloads  Leverage existing identity management infrastructure and security
groups to assign roles
Platform and Integrations
 Manage users with LDAP/Active Directory and Single-Sign-On  Send events to SIEM, analytics and monitoring solutions  Collaborate across teams with Slack, PagerDuty and
Jira integrations  Run as self-hosted solution or consume as SaaS
