Cloud-Delivered Network Visibility & Control

The proliferation of IoT use in business, open BYOD policies, and a global remote workforce exponentially increases the quantity of unmanaged IP-enabled devices directly neighboring enterprise infrastructure. One compromised printer can become an adversary's home base for reconnaissance, lateral movement, and a breach.
SentinelOne addresses this risk with Ranger, an integral component of our Singularity XDR Platform that turns endpoint Sentinel agents into distributed network sensors. Sentinel Rangers enable control of the enterprise network attack surface in real time by discovering, identifying, and containing any device-based threat. Your endpoints can now autonomously protect compute infrastructure from IoT attacks, compromised devices, and vulnerabilities. No hardware. No network changes. Simply enable Ranger in the endpoint policy and the Sentinel agents get it done.

SentinelOne Singularity XDR

SOLUTION BRIEF

The cybersecurity threat landscape is rapidly evolving and expanding. As attack vectors multiply, from endpoints to networks to the cloud, many enterprises address each vector with a best-in-class solution to protect those specific vulnerabilities. However, these point tools don't connect the dots across the entire technology stack. As a result, security data is collected and analyzed in isolation, without any context or correlation, creating gaps in what security teams can see and detect. Besides, the manual investigation process can often be slow and cumbersome, causing security teams to fall behind in containing and remediating threats.
Singularity XDR
SentinelOne Singularity XDR unifies and extends detection and response capability across multiple security layers, providing security teams with centralized end-to-end enterprise visibility, powerful analytics, automated response across the complete technology stack. With Singularity XDR, customers can get unified and proactive security measures to defend the entire technology stack, making it easier for security analysts to identify and stop attacks in progress before they impact the business.
Key Capabilities
01 Eliminate blind spots with cross-stack visibility
Singularity XDR enables enterprises to seamlessly ingest structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data in real-time from any technology product or platform, breaking down data silos and eliminating critical blind spots. The solution empowers security teams to see data collected by disparate security solutions from all platforms, including endpoints, cloud workloads, IoT devices, networks, and more, within a single dashboard. Singularity XDR lets analysts take advantage of insights derived from aggregating event information from multiple different solutions into a single contextualized "incident". It also provides customers with a central enforcement and analytics layer point hub for complete enterprise visibility and autonomous prevention, detection, and response, helping organizations address cybersecurity challenges from a unified standpoint.
02 Uncover stealthy attacks with cross-stack correlation
SentinelOne patented StorylineTM technology provides real-time, automated machine-built context and correlation across the enterprise security stack to transform disconnected data

SOLUTION BENEFITS
Increased SOC Efficiency and Productivity No context switches or multiple dashboards in response minimizes delays. One platform and one workflow reduces the number of alerts, eliminates blind spots and data gaps, and reduces the number of interfaces that security must access during a response.
Rapid Time to Value Out-of-the-box integrations across multiple different products. Enables you to maximize value from your existing cybersecurity investment rapidly.
Streamlined Operations & Workflows Achieve single-pane visibility & analysis for siloed data streams.
Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Reduce the costs associated with configuring and integrating multiple point solutions with a fully integrated cybersecurity platform.

into rich stories and lets security analysts understand the full story of what happened in their environment. Storyline automatically links all related events and activities together in a storyline with a unique identifier. This allows security teams to see the full context of what occurred within seconds rather than needing to spend hours, days, or weeks correlating logs and linking events manually. SentinelOne's behavioral engine tracks all system activities across your environment, including file/registry changes, service start/stop, inter-process communication, and network activity. It detects techniques and tactics that are indicators of malicious behavior to monitor stealth behavior, effectively identify fileless attacks, lateral movement, and actively executing rootkits. Singularity XDR automatically correlates related activity into unified alerts that provide campaign-level insight and allows enterprises to correlate events across different vectors to facilitate triage of alerts as a single incident.

enabling customers to accelerate threat investigation and triage capabilities. Customers can also leverage a query library of hunts curated by SentinelOne research which continually evaluates new methodologies to uncover new IOCs and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).
04 Automate response across different domains
Singularity XDR enables analysts to take all the required actions to automatically resolve threats with one click, without scripting, on one, several, or all devices across the estate. With one click, the analyst can execute remediation actions such as network quarantine, auto-deploy an agent on a rogue workstation, or automate policy enforcement across cloud environments. Singularity XDR also lets customers leverage the insights Storyline delivers to create custom automated detection rules specific to their environment with Storyline Active-Response (STAR). STAR lets enterprises incorporate their business context and customize the EDR solution to their needs. With Storyline Active-Response (STAR) custom detection rules, you can turn queries into automated hunting rules that trigger alerts and responses when rules detect matches. STAR gives you the flexibility to create custom alerts and responses specific to your environment; for example, auto-kill a process to automatically and rapidly detect and contain threats across your environment.
05 Frictionless integration with leading SOAR tools
As you may have other security tools and technologies deployed in your SOC, SentinelOne offers a growing portfolio of integrations to third-party systems like SIEM and SOAR via Singularity Marketplace. Singularity Apps are hosted on our scalable serverless Function-as-a-Service cloud platform and joined together with API-enabled IT and Security controls with a few clicks. Singularity Marketplace is part of our platform, so once the integration is set up, the effect becomes immediately visible within the product - removing the barriers of writing complex code, making automation simple and scalable between vendors. Security teams can easily navigate the best course of action to remediate and defeat high-velocity threats by driving a unified, orchestrated response among security tools in different domains.

"
Data ingest is a major challenge for most vendors. To accommodate the volume, velocity, and variety of security data, XDR technologies must be anchored by a modern data pipeline that can collect and process security data at scale across hybrid IT.
XDR technologies should also be able to provide automated machine-built context and correlation to provide the security team with automated insights across the enterprise security stack.
