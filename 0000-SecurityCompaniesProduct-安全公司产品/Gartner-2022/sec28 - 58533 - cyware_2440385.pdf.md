DATASHEET

An Any-to-Any Vendor Agnostic Orchestration platform for connecting & automating Cyber, IT, and DevOps workflows across Cloud, On-Premise, and Hybrid environments
The ever-increasing complexity and variety of cybersecurity tools has resulted in analysts needing to spend a lot of their time analyzing and responding to security events which mostly are repetitive in nature. This has led to analysts getting burnout and organizations giving delayed threat responses. To counter this and improve the pace of threat response, organizations are adopting Cyware's powerful security orchestration platform as a means to integrate, orchestrate and automate their security operations spanning across a wide variety of security tools from heterogeneous vendors deployed across di erent environments.
Cyware Orchestrate allows security teams to create customized automation playbooks to execute various manual, repetitive tasks in a reliable machine-driven manner. Cyware Orchestrate enables machine-to-machine (M2M), human-to-machine (H2M), and machine-to-human (M2H) security orchestration through integrations with a wide range of deployed security tools and technologies.
Cyware Orchestrate helps organizations streamline and automate their security operations by enabling disparate tools and technologies from di erent vendors to talk to each other without having to rely on any manual e ort for data normalization, enrichment, and analysis. By deploying Cyware Orchestrate, organizations can significantly reduce mean time to respond (MTTR) and increase operational e ciency along with overall return on investment (ROI) in cybersecurity.

Cyware Threat Intelligence eXchange (CTIX)
An Any-to-Any Threat Intelligence Analysis and Sharing Platform

DATASHEET

The inability to ingest and analyze threat intelligence has rendered organizations vulnerable to advanced security threats.
Organizations are lacking preventive, predictive and relevant threat intelligence, which holds the key to identify, prioritize and contain threats targeting their networks and endpoints. The huge amount of threat data coming from disparate internal security tools often ends up flooding the analysis, correlation and mitigation procedures rendering them dysfunctional. To overcome these challenges, many organizations are now moving towards automated Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs) that act as an integrated dashboard for the ingestion, analysis, and actioning of threat data recieved from multiple external sources and internal security tools.
Cyware Threat Intelligence eXchange (CTIX) is an intelligent client-server exchange that leverages advanced technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to automatically ingest, analyze, correlate and take action upon the threat data ingested from multiple external sources and internally deployed security tools. CTIX comes with the capability to systematically convert, store and organize actionable threat data from various structured formats including STIX 1.x, STIX 2.0, XML, JSON, Cybox, OpenIOC, MAEC and unstructured formats such as Email, RSS Feeds, Threat Blogs, etc., making it a truly format-agnostic Threat Intelligence Platform.
CTIX's unique capability to ingest and action upon threat data collected from internally deployed security tools is complemented by its "Hub and Spoke" design architecture that allows organizations to create trusted sharing communities with clients, vendors, peers,
ACs/ISAOs and regulatory bodies for exchange of specific, relevant and validated cyber threat intelligence.
